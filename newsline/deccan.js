    "content": "Unfazed by large scale protests over diesel price hike, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today asserted it was a step in the right direction and expressed the hope that economy would rebound in the second half of the current fiscal.<br /><br />\"The recent increase in diesel prices is an important step in the right direction,\" he said while addressing the meeting of the Full Planning Commission which was called to approve the 12th Five Year Plan document.<br /><br />The Prime Minister also made a case for comprehensive review of energy policy saying it was vital for energy security of the country.<br /><br />Energy, Singh said, \"is a difficult area where policy needs a comprehensive review. We are energy deficient and import dependence is going up. It is vital for our energy security that we increase domestic production and also increase the energy efficiency.<br /><br />\"Rational energy pricing is therefore critical. Our energy prices are out of line with the world prices\", he added.<br /><br />The government had recently increased the price of diesel by Rs 5 a litre and capped the use of subsidised LPG cylinder to six in a year per family, evoking sharp protests all over the country.<br /><br />Referring to global economic issues, Prime Minister said, \"these short term problems present a challenge, but they should not lead to undue pessimism about our medium term prospects.<br /><br />\"The economy has gained many strengths. Our immediate priority must be to orchestrate a rebound in the second half of the current year. We should then try to accelerate growth to reach around 9 percent by the end of the Plan period,\" he added.<br /><br />The 12th Plan (2012-17) is proposing an annual average growth rate of 8.2 per cent, which is lower than the earlier estimate of the 9 per cent. The economy recorded a growth rate of 7.9 per cent in the 11th Plan.<br /><br />According to the Prime Minister, the 11th Plan growth rate was commendable, \"for a period which saw two global crises - one in 2008 and another in 2011\".<br /><br />Singh further said that poverty declined twice as fast between financial years 2004-05 and 2009-10 than it did in the previous ten years, while the agriculture grew at 3.3 percent per year in the 11th Plan, much faster than the 2.4 percent observed in the 10th Plan.<br /><br />As regards the growth prospects in the 12th Plan, Singh said, \"we must also recognise that the 12th Plan is starting in a year when the world economy is experiencing difficulties and our economy has also slowed down\".<br /><br />Referring to scaling down of the target in the 12th Plan from the original estimate of 9 per cent to 8.2 per cent, he said, \"some downward revision is realistic given the state of the world\".<br /><br />Cautioning that growth could slip if adequate actions were not taken, Prime Minister said, \"I believe we can make Scenario I (which envisages growth rate of 8.2 per cent) possible. It will take courage and some risks but it should be our endeavour to ensure that it materialises. The country deserves no less.\"<br /><br />Referring to the infrastructure sector, Singh said efforts would be made to speed up implementation of the projects.<br /><br />\"This is critical for removing supply bottlenecks which constrain growth in other sectors. It will also boost investor sentiment to raise the overall rate of investment,\" he said while calling on the infrastructure ministries to set ambitious goals for their sectors over the 12th Plan.<br /><br />The country needs close to USD 1 trillion of investment in infrastructure (in the 12th Plan period), he said, adding, \"We have to work hard to achieve this\".<br /><br />The Prime Minister said he would himself review the performance of the infrastructure ministries to ensure speedy implementation of the targets.<br /><br />He also emphasised the need for reviving investment in the economy to push growth. \"The second component relates to macro-economic balance. To achieve the target of 8.2 per cent growth we need to revive investment in the economy. The investment environment is therefore critical,\" he added.<br /><br />At the same time, he said, efforts were needed to encourage Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) to deal with the problem of current account deficit.<br /><br />\"Because export prospects are weak, the Plan projects a current account deficit of 2.9 per cent of GDP. This must be financed mainly through FDI and FII flows...I believe we can attract the financing we need provided our fiscal deficit is seen to be coming under control and the growth momentum is regained,\" he said.<br /><br />On fiscal deficit, he said, \"(it) is too high and is attracting adverse comment from analysts. It must be brought down over the medium term to release domestic resources for productive deployment in the economy\".<br /><br />Talking about the social sector targets in the 12th Plan, Singh said, ambitious programmes were being put in place in areas like health, education, water resource management, MGNREGA, PMGSY, and the National Rural Livelihoods Mission.",

The ministry of defence has agreed in principle for the launch of the project,\" State Director of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) Sarat Chandra Sahu said on Friday.<br /><br />\"The Chinese system has been rejected. Now the Paradip station will have an improvised German-made Doppler radar,\" Sahu said.<br /><br />\"The China-made doppler radar system is still in our possession. After the defence ministry directed us not to install the China-made set, it has not been put to use. The building and other infrastructures are ready for the launch of the state-of-the-art weather station. Once the German-made system is provided to us, the station will get operational without any further delay,\" he informed.<br /><br />Security concerns were raised by the Union defence ministry. It was feared that the in-built chips in the radar might help to pass on vital information to the manufacturing country, said an official.<br /><br />The obsolete analogue radar installed at the Paradip weather station for weather forecast has turned defunct even as harried meteorology personnel are now entirely dependent on the weathermen at Vishakhapatnam and Kolkata for forecast update, Sahu said.<br />",

In another key move, the government gave its nod for divestment in four public sector companies, including its flagship Oil India, to raise up to Rs 15,000 crore.<br /><br />According to decisions taken at the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs and Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, foreign companies will be allowed to invest up to 51 per cent in multi-brand retail while FDI in Indian carriers will be pegged at 49 per cent.<br /><br />At the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was understood to have brushed aside apprehensions of some of his colleagues on the tough decisions as he asserted: \"Time for big-bang reforms has come. If we have to go down, we will go down fighting.\"<br /><br />As for the opposition from some political parties and states, the government had a way out as Commerce Minister Anand Sharma, who briefed the media on Cabinet approvals, said: \"There is an enabling provision.

Leading domestic retail firm Bharti is already in talks with Wal-Mart for a tie-up. Sharma said some states such as Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi and Maharashtra were in favour of FDI while those who have reservations on opening the multi-brand to foreign players, including  Orissa, Bihar and West Bengal, may use their discretion. \"We will notify the policy without any delay,\" he remarked.",

This will contribute more to the power sector,\" Power Minister M Veerappa Moily said at a function here, when asked if his ministry would ask the government for the de-allocated coal blocks for its capacity addition programmes in the next five year plan. <br /><br />On the recommendation of the inter-ministerial group, the Coal Ministry has so far decided to de-allocate four coal blocks. <br /><br />The Planning Commission has set a power capacity addition target of 88,425 MW for the next five year Plan period ending March, 2017 to bridge the growing demand-supply gap for electricity. The total generation target for the twelfth Plan is 1,18,425 MW, including renewable energy capacity addition of 30,000 MW.<br /><br />Availability of coal for the coal based thermal power stations has been a matter of serious concern. Due to inadequate availability of domestic coal, coal companies are not in a position to supply full quantity of coal to power plants. <br /><br />As a result of this, power utilities are required to use imported coal to bridge the shortfall. However, use of imported coal and rise in cost of imported coal has impacted electricity generation as well as its cost, according to sources in the ministry. <br /><br />Generation loss<br /><br />During April, 2011 to February, 2012, power utilities reported a generation loss of 8.7 billion units due to inadequate availability of coal. <br /><br />Increase in cost of generation due to blending of imported coal with domestic coal depends on the quality and grade of imported and domestic coal, origin of country transportation from port to power station. The ultra mega power plants, based on imported coal, have also been affected due to increase in cost of imported coal, sources said.<br /><br />As per government estimates, as much as 515 million tonnes coal will be required in power sector in 2012-13, 572 million tonnes in 2013-14 and 650 million tonnes in 2014-15. The likely coal availability from Coal India Limited is assessed to be 347 million tonnes in 2012-13, 364 million tonnes in 2013-14 and 381 million tonnes in 2014-15. The expected availability of coal from SCCL is just 34 million tonnes in each of the three fiscals starting from 2012-13. <br /><br />The coal availability from captive mines in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 is expected to be 27 million tonnes, 38 million tonnes and 56 million tonnes respectively. <br /><br />To meet the demand-supply gap for thermal power stations designed on domestic coal, 76 million tonnes coal will be required to be imported in 2012-13, 92 million tonnes in 2013-14 and 128 million tonnes in 2014-15.<br />",

He said his party was not consulted by the Centre on the issue.<br /><br />Demanding a rollback, the Left said it will discuss with other political parties the issue of launching a \"powerful\" movement against the hike and also took the opportunity to attack Trinamool Congress for its \"hypocrisy and double standards\".<br /><br />CPI(M) General Secretary Prakash Karat said both the diesel price hike and LPG restriction will hit the common people and said his party will strongly protest the move.<br /><br />Charging the Centre with lacking economic ideas to tackle the fuel price hike, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa demanded immediate rollback    of diesel price and the ceiling on supply of subsidised cylinders.<br /><br />In Bhubaneshwar, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik termed the diesel hike and restriction on LPG cylinders as a \"breakdown\" of the Centre's economic policies and demanded immediate rollback of the decision.

The counsel contended that if such an order is passed by the special judge, it is unheard of as there is no provision under 164 CrPC to issue summons to a witness.<br /><br />In other words, it was argued that a statement under 164 CrPC can be recorded only voluntarily and not through summons. At this stage, the bench said it would examine the said summoning order and accordingly directed the CBI to place on record before it the application moved by the agency before the special judge for summoning of the witness.<br /><br />During the argument, the bench also observed that \"Mr Gopal Subramaniam, with your wide experience you know that resourceful persons even while sitting in the jail can get their things done outside.\"<br /><br />Additional Solicitor General Mohan Jain appeared for the CBI. <br /><br />On September 11, while opposing Jagan's bail plea, the CBI had claimed that the trail of his alleged disproportionate assets extended not only to different states but also to several countries.<br /><br />\"The respondent submits that the case against the petitioner A-1 (Jagan) and other accused has a large magnitude not only confined to the state of Andhra Pradesh but also extends to the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Delhi and several foreign countries.<br /><br />\"Therefore, the public perception in the rule of law and majesty of justice will suffer dilution. In the present case, the petitioner and other accused have impoverished the state exchequer with several thousand crores and the petitioner in particular has enriched himself to a large magnitude only through resorting to illegal and corrupt methods.<br /><br />\"In a short span of time to be precise within a period of five years the petitioner herein has enriched himself to several thousands of crores illegally and by subversion of the system,\" the CBI had claimed in its affidavit.<br /><br />In its affidavit, the CBI had alleged that Jagan had enriched himself by several thousands of crores rupees illegally by using influence of his father and granting him bail at this juncture would erode public confidence in the administration of justice.<br /><br />The agency had filed the affidavit in response to the apex court's notice to the CBI last month on Jagan's plea for bail in the DA case being probed by it and the Enforcement Directorate.<br /><br />According to the CBI, Jagan had made several attempts to influence witnesses, has not cooperated with the investigating agencies, attempted to stifle investigation and prosecution by filing several petitions and initiating frivolous proceedings.<br /><br />The CBI had also alleged that having regard to the huge finances available at the disposal of Jagan and his political clout, he is likely to interfere with the process of further probe being conducted by it in the case.",

You arrest a cartoonist and breach his liberty of freedom of speech and expression,\" a division bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and Amjad Sayyed said while hearing a PIL filed by lawyer Sanskar Marathe claiming Trivedi's arrest was illegal and unjustified.<br /><br />The Kanpur-based cartoonist, arrested last Saturday on sedition charges, was released two days back after the high court granted him bail amid mounting public outrage.<br /><br />Observing that Trivedi's arrest was prima facie \"arbitrary\", the court said, \"We have one Aseem Trivedi who was courageous enough to raise his voice and stand against this, but what about several others whose voices are shut by police.\"<br /><br />Noting that the police would have to satisfy the court as to how the sedition charge was applied against the young cartoonist, the judges said they intended to lay down certain parameters for application of the law of sedition.<br /><br />\"If there are no parameters there will be serious encroachment of a person's liberties guaranteed to him in a civil society,\" the bench said. It said the sedition law was a pre-independence provision when government wanted protection from the citizens.<br /><br />\"What is the government's stand now? Does it intend to drop the charge? someone has to take political responsibility for this. Why did the police not apply its mind before arresting him on sedition charges,\" the court wanted to know. <br /><br />Directing the police to file a comprehensive affidavit by October 12 explaining the grounds on which the charge of sedition was applied, the court said, \"Today you attacked a cartoonist, tomorrow you will attack a filmmaker and then a writer.

Advocate Mihir Desai, appearing for Trivedi, told the court he would file an affidavit seeking to quash the case on the next date of hearing.<br /><br />Trivedi was arrested on September 8 for allegedly posting seditious content on his website and insulting the national emblem and Parliament. He was on Monday remanded in judicial custody till September 24, after police said it no longer required his custody and Trivedi refused to seek bail. However, the high court granted him bail two days later.<br /><br />The city police had come under fire from activists and politicians including BJP leader L K Advani and Shiv Sena's Bal Thackeray over his arrest.",

    "content": "The BJP, which is gunning for the prime minister's head in the coal scam, will be required to explain a lot on why Arjun Munda, Chief Minister in the BJP government in Jharkhand, recommended a private company for coal block allocation eight years ago.  <br /><br />During his maiden stint as the Jharkhand Chief Minister, Munda wrote to the erstwhile Minister of State (MoS) for Coal, Dasari Narayan Rao, on August 20, 2004, recommending that Corporate Ispat Alloys Ltd (CIAL) be allotted captive coal block in Chitterpur, to provide fuel for the sponge iron plant that was to be set up in Hazaribagh.<br /><br />CIAL is a subsidiary of Manoj Jaiswal's Abhijit Group, which is now facing the CBI heat over the alleged irregularities in block allocation. An Inter Ministerial Group had recently issued a show cause notice to CIAL, seeking its explanation on the failure to start extraction of coal from the blocks yet. <br /><br />&quot;We recommend the allotment of the above coal blocks to CIAL. I shall be grateful if you could kindly issue appropriate instructions to the concerned officials of the ministry&amp;hellip;,&quot; Munda wrote to Rao. Deccan Herald is in possession of the correspondence between Munda and the ministry. <br /><br />A year later, the Coal Ministry informed CIAL on September 2, 2005, that it was awarded the right to mine natural resources in Chitterpur to meet the requirement for 36 million tonnes of coal for sponge iron production. <br /><br />Rao and Santosh Bagrodia are the two ministers whose roles in the coal scam are under the scanner. Neither Munda nor Rao could be contacted for comments.<br /><br />Interestingly, Munda wrote to Rao recommending CIAL after the company failed to elicit a positive response from the Coal Ministry despite repeated efforts since 2000.  It had first applied in July 2000 but got no response in the next three years, despite making four representations to the ministry.  <br /><br /> CIAL is one of the 57 private companies mentioned in the Comptroller and Auditor General's performance audit report on coal block allocation, which has stirred up a hornet's nest. A total of 27 coal blocks were allotted in Jharkhand between May 2005 and June 2009, of which 13 were handed over to different companies during Munda's tenure as the chief minister. <br /><br />Though it is not clear whether Munda recommended any other company besides CIAL, the Abhijit Group was alloted as many as five blocks. On a single day, May 26, 2005, Abhijeet Infrastructure Ltd was alloted three different opencast coal mines in Jharkhand.<br /><br />Owner Manoj Jaiswal's name appears in the five FIRs that CBI has filed in the case.<br />A fortnight before holding a review meeting, a complicit Coal Ministry, in a letter to the Jharkhand chief secretary on March 10, 2008, stated that they \"may review development of coal blocks and associated end use plants in their state\" as \"progress of the block involves inter action of the allocate with respective state government.\"<br /><br /> CIAL, along with other companies under the Abhijeet group, figured in the annexed list of about 60 private companies and Public sector units that got coal blocks in the state.<br />",

The YSRC, in an effort to distance itself from the National Democratic Alliance, had voted for veteran Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee in the recently held presidential election. But  it denied any patch-up with the Congress.<br /><br />It all started when Vijayamma was asked about the possibility of her party merging with the Congress, she had reportedly said \"future will decide that.\" <br /><br />Taking a cue from this, it was noted that she has not ruled out the possibility. Asked specifically whether she would rule out the possibility of either YSRC's merger or alliance with Congress, she said the future would decide that. \"Jagan Babu has already said that we will not have any truck with the 'communal' NDA,\" she said keeping her other options open.<br /><br />Soon after her interview was carried in the media, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) said that its stand is vindicated as Vijayamma has already admitted that her party would be merged with the Congress. <br /><br />TDP spokespersons said that the possibility of a merger became evident when a book based on the diary of Y S Rajasekhara Reddy was recently unveiled in New Delhi. They said top Congress leaders attending the programme was a clear indication of the imminent merger.<br /><br />Reacting sharply to the reports, YSRC leaders said that media had misquoted Vijayamma. <br />In a two-line press release, Vijayamma said \"the YSRC rules out merger with the Congress.\" But little did they know that Vijayamma's remarks had been not only recorded but also uploaded in YouTube.<br />",

Krishna's meeting with the prime minister took place on September 11, two days after he returned from a visit to Pakistan.<br /><br />Sources also told this newspaper that Pakistan is unlikely to walk the extra mile to expedite the trial of the Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Zaki Ur Rahman Laqvi and six others in connection with the November 26-29, 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The skeptics in Islamabad believe that even if the seven LeT men were tried expeditiously to set the stage for Indian Prime Minister's visit, New Delhi might ask for more, including investigation into the role of the Pakistan's state agencies in plotting the 26/11 attacks and arrest of Hafiz Saeed, the suspected mastermind of the carnage. <br /><br />During external affairs minister's visit to the neighbouring country last weekend, New Delhi is understood to have declined to budge from its stand that Islamabad should not only expedite the trial of the 26/11 attacks, but must also put Saeed behind bars and investigate the role of the Pakistani \"state actors\" in plotting the attacks in Mumbai.Sources in the Congress said that it would be \"very difficult\" for the party to endorse prime minister's visit to Pakistan \"at this juncture\", unless Islamabad did take some significant steps to prove New Delhi's core concern on terrorism emanating from the neighbouring country.<br /><br />With the UPA government being beleaguered by a series of scams and the BJP demanding prime minister's resignation over the Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) report on coal block allocation between 2006 and 2009, the Congress is cautious to make it sure that it is not accused of going soft on Pakistan, particularly on the issue of terror.<br /><br />Politically, the Congress is said to be of the opinion that a visit of the prime minister would be more beneficial to the Pakistan People's Party which leads the government there. <br />",

The questions in the aptitude test may be uniform for all the candidates.<br /><br />At present, most of the central universities conduct their own entrance tests for undergraduate and post graduate courses, except the central universities of Tamil Nadu, Kashmir, Rajasthan, Kerala, Jharkhand, Bihar and Jammu. \"Under a mutual agreement, these universities have been successfully holding a common entrance test for admission for the last three years,\" sources said.<br /><br />A proposal to hold a common entrance test for admission to central universities was made about two years ago. Favouring the idea, a committee comprising the vice-chancellors of the central universities, headed by the erstwhile VC of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, B B Bhattacharya, had said in its final report that a common entrance test was needed, but each institution should have the autonomy to choose how to admit students.<br /><br />It had also suggested that the common entrance test should be used more as an eligibility test, like the National Eligibility Test (NET) conducted by the University Grants Commission (UGC).",

It is an important cog and is part of court attached system of administration of justice unlike a ministerial tribunal which is more influenced and controlled and performs functions akin to machinery of administration,\" the bench said.<br /><br />The court, which refused to term those provisions of the RTI Act as unconstitutional, laid down the qualification of a judicial member saying that he or she should be a person having at 20 years of practice of law with experience in social work.<br /><br />The appointment of judicial member would be undertaken in consultation with the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and Chief Justice of respective high courts in case of states, the court said.<br /><br />The Central and State Information Commissions have dual jurisdiction -appellate as well as supervisory and investigative authority - as imposed penalty and recommended disciplinary action against those public information officers who failed to respond to the queries made under the Act.<br /><br />\"The commission is not administrative simpliciter but is quasijudicial in nature. It exercises powers and functions which are adjudicatory in character and legal in nature,\" the court said.<br /><br />Directing for bringing amendment into the transparency law, the bench said, \"The terminology used by the legislature, such as 'mass-media' or 'administration and governance', are terms of uncertain tenor and amplitude. It is somewhat difficult to state with exactitude as to what class of persons would be eligible under these categories.\"<br /><br />The Sub-Section (5) of Section 12 of the Act dealing with the eligibility criteria for appointment to the post of the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners stated that the persons of eminence in public life with wide knowledge and experience in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass media or administration and governance would be appointed to the posts.<br />",

The Dalit students at the Ambedkar hostel became the soft target. Bihar has a history of bloody clash between the upper caste landlords (represented by Ranveer Sena) and CPI-Maoists (representing the poor and weaker sections).<br /><br />On the run for more than three months, the Dalit students heaved a sigh of relief when the SC/ST panel and the human rights body reprimanded the Nitish regime for failing to protect the weaker section boys and ordered to duly compensate the victims.<br /><br />The Bihar government eventually decided to hand over a cheque of Rs 15,000 to each of the 350 students in Ambedkar hostel. So far 200 students have received the compensation amount, while others, who are on their way to the hostel, would be handed over the cheque after reaching Bhojpur.<br /><br /> \"Besides, Rs 89 lakh has been proposed to carry out the repair works at the hostel, which was vandalised by lumpen elements on June 1.

The Congress is therefore desperately hoping for an electoral edge even though insiders acknowledge that Rahul Gandhi is unlikely to hold the magic wand.<br /><br />He wasn't successful in Uttar Pradesh earlier this year. The odds are anyway enormous with corruption scandals and the economy in doldrums. But the prince-in-waiting is young, has a clean image of an idealist and, of course, the famed Gandhi charisma, say Congress workers.<br /><br />They are willing to stake their all on Rahul Gandhi, despite stringent attacks by the opposition and scepticism by political observers on whether he was ready to take the initiative. On Wednesday, even the Samajwadi Party that gives outside support to the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), said it has no faith in Rahul Gandhi. <br /><br />\"Whoever understands Indian politics will say that Rahul Gandhi does not seem to have the qualities to lead the country in view of the challenges it s facing,\" party leader  Mohan Singh said in Kolkata.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Congress leaders say Gandhi's next move, talked about for over a year and a half, is expected to boost the morale of the party, still smarting from the opposition charges of corruption, electoral debacles in states like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab in March, and faulty allocation of coal blocks.<br /><br />\"Whatever changes have to be done should be done in time, so that the new leaders get adequate time to prepare the party for the electoral challenges ahead,\" said a cabinet minister who did not wish to be named.<br /><br />\"We want a bigger role for Rahul Gandhi,\" the minister told IANS.<br /><br />Rahul Gandhi's elevation within the party or his taking on a ministerial berth is expected to prepare the party ahead of the big political battle of  the 2014 general election and the slew of state polls before that.<br /><br />It is, however, clear that United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi would lead the country's oldest party in the next Lok Sabha polls.<br /><br />Rahul Gandhi, who entered electoral politics in 2004 and has taken charge of the Indian Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India, had indicated in July that he was ready for a more \"proactive\" role.<br /><br />But the timing, he said, would be decided by his mother, Sonia Gandhi, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.<br /><br />While the prime minister has time and again expressed hope that Rahul Gandhi will assume a greater role in the government, Sonia Gandhi had said that her son alone will take the final call.<br /><br />Top leaders said Rahul Gandhi's elevation in the party hierarchy was almost certain, but a section of the Congress wants him to play a role in Manmohan Singh's cabinet as well.<br /><br />Young parliamentarians hinted he may take up a ministry like rural development, human resource development or health -- portfolios which identify with his pro-poor and development-oriented ideas.<br /><br />\"This would give him government experience... but he (Rahul) has to take the final call,\" said a young MP who has been associated with Rahul Gandhi in democratising the Youth Congress.<br /><br />However, some leaders felt the Nehru-Gandhi family scion should remain focussed on his long-term goal of reviving the grand old party across the country.<br /><br />This suits his style of working too, said party sources.<br /><br />Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh, who worked closely with Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh, has said the young leader should focus on the party.<br /><br />According to Zoya Hasan, who teaches political science at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, there was pressure on Rahul Gandhi and he must assume the leadership role.<br /><br />\"He should come to the forefront.

    "content": "Despite the government's efforts to improve maternal and child health, the latest report released by UNICEF shows India had the highest number of deaths of children under five years of age in 2011.<br /><br />World Health Organisation (WHO) India Representative Nata Menabde, however, says that given the size of the population, absolute numbers will always be high in case of India. This should not overshadow the fact that the country has made significant progress in the field of health.<br /><br />The UNICEF report, released Thursday in New York, says almost 19,000 children less than five years of age die every day across the world. India tops the list of countries for 2011, with the highest number of such deaths at 16.55 lakh.<br /><br />As per the report, even as overall child mortality in the world has gone down, under-five deaths are increasingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In 2011, 82 percent of under-five deaths occurred in these two regions, up from 68 percent in 1990.<br /><br />In 2011, about half of global under-five deaths occurred in just five countries: India, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and China. Though on the top of list in terms of absolute numbers, in terms of child mortality rate, India ranks 49th with 61 deaths per thousand children in 2011. Sierra Leone has the highest child mortality rate of 185 per thousand.<br /><br />\"There has been lot of improvement in last couple of years, with interventions like the National Rural Health Mission. In most areas, India will hopefully come close to the MDGs (Millennium Development Goals),\" Menabde said at a press conference here.<br /><br />The MDGs are eight international development goals that all member states of the UN  agreed to achieve by 2015. One of the MDGs is to reduce under-five mortality rate of 42 per 1,000 live births by 2015. <br /><br />According to projections by WHO, India will reach 52 percent by that year, missing the target by 10 percentage points.<br /><br />\"India may not achieve the MDG, but will come close to the target. It is important to maintain the pace even after the time period of the MDGs, so that the projections can be achieved,\" Menabde said. <br /><br />According to the UNICEF report, China reported 2.49 lakh deaths of under-5 children last year, followed by 1.94 lakh by Ethiopia and 1.34 lakh each by Indonesia and Bangladesh. <br /><br />Uganda with 1.31 lakh such deaths and Afghanistan with 1.28 lakh deaths held the ninth and 10th position in the list of 10 top countries reporting under-five children deaths.<br /><br />On the positive side, however, the report shows that the overall number of under-five deaths worldwide has decreased from nearly 12 million in 1990 to less than 7 million in 2011, and the rate of the decline has been steadily increasing.<br /><br />\"The rate of decline in under-five mortality has drastically accelerated in the last decade - from 1.8 percent per year during the 1990s to 3.2 percent per year between 2000 and 2011,\" the report says.",

There are poor people living in the vicinity of the plant and they should know that their life would be protected,\" a bench of justices K S Radhakrishanan and Deepak Misra said while posting the matter for hearing on September 20.<br /><br />The bench, which refused to stay the fuel loading after the centre assured the court that commissioning of the plant will take place at least two months, said it would go through the judgements of the Madras High Court and hear the matter.<br /><br />\"We are not against the plant, nor the petitioner but we want to see that recommendations of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) on the safety measures have been implemented,\" the bench said.<br /><br />The Centre was represented in full strength with Attorney General G E Vahanvati, Solicitor General Rohinton Nariman and Additional Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran vociferously opposing the plea for staying fuel loading.<br /><br />The Centre said the plant is \"completely safe\".  Since all the recommendations made by the Board cannot be put in place in one go, it would be implemented in due course within six months to two years, it said.<br /><br />The court was hearing an appeal by social activist G Sundarrajan against the High Court's decision refusing to impose any restraint against the plant. <br /><br />According to the petition, the government's Task Force had made a detailed review of the safety measures of the project in the light of inadequacies of Fukushmia plant which suffered due to lack of alternative fresh water storage and want of back-up power system.<br /><br />The Task Force had sought implementation of its 17 recommendations before commissioning units 1 and 2 of KKNPP, the petition said.<br /><br />The important recommendations among other things related to provision of alternative fresh water storage system and emergency pumping equipment, which are yet to be implemented even today, it added.<br /><br />It said the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) now states that implementation of these measures would take six months to 2 years.<br /><br />\"If, by chance, any natural disaster happens before the said measures are implemented, there is every chance of a meltdown and huge leakage of radiation that would make a large area uninhabitable for decades and would need evacuation of millions of people,\" the petition said.<br /><br />The petitioner said the AERB could not act independently in the matter because it is under the Atomic Energy Department and hence is unable to act firmly.<br /><br />\"India's nuclear safety regulator AERB is a body under the control of the very department it is supposed to regulate and merely acts as a rubber-stamping authority, and thereby, it has put to grave risk the rights of the citizens under Article 21 of the Constitution,\" the petition said.<br /><br />The petitioner said with the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 coming into force from September 21, 2010, the liability of the nuclear plant operator and supplier has been pegged at a meagre Rs 1500 crores \"in complete violation of the absolute liability principle\" propounded by the apex court in its earlier judgements on environmental issues.<br /><br />\"Russia claims that it is exempt from even this minimal liability since their contract with the Indian government states that they would not be liable,\" the petition said.",

It is the responsibility of the utility (NPCIL) and not AERB. We will only ensure whether safety measures have been met or not,\" he said.<br /><br />Kudankulam and its adjoining villages are witnessing a fresh wave of protests led by anti-nuclear activists and the locals against commissioning of the atomic power plant.<br />Bajaj refused to be drawn into a debate on the timeframe commissioning of the plant and made it clear that it was the responsibility of the operator.<br /><br />\"Timeframe for commissioning of the plant are issues with the utility.

The BCCI assisted the Deccan Chargers and we also looked at the eligibility criteria, whether they are fit and proper.<br /><br />\"We found that the party was acceptable to us. After that it was between Deccan Chargers and the bidder, there the BCCI was not involved. But they informed us that the price and terms were not suitable, so they didn't accept it,\" BCCI President N Srinivasan told reporters.<br /><br />Asked if a new tender will be floated since the lone bid has been rejected, Srinivasan said, \"You have to ask Deccan Chargers, now it's upto them. The franchise is on (exist).<br /><br /> The BCCI has issued a notice to the franchise to clear certain defects. We have given them some time, but that is between BCCI and the franchise.\"<br /><br />The BCCI later issued a press release and said the Board had no role in Chargers' decision to reject the bid.<br /><br />\"The bid that was received by Deccan Chronicle Holdings Limited met the BCCI's eligibility and suitability criteria. The bid was then reviewed by Deccan Chronicle Holdings Limited who, in its discretion and with no role being played by BCCI, rejected the bid on the basis of the payment terms offered by the bidder,\" BCCI Secretary Sanjay Jagdale said in the release.<br /><br />\"The Invitation to Tender that was announced on 6 September 2012 by Deccan Chronicle Holdings Limited, under the aegis of BCCI, concluded today under the observation of Mr. Narvekar, appointed by the Mumbai High Court,\" said Jagdale.<br /><br />The development has put the BCCI in a quandary as it was expecting the franchise to resolve its financial problems by finding a buyer for itself.<br /><br />A top BCCI official indicated that the Chargers' contract could be terminated at the Working Committee meeting and a new tender could be floated. There was also a possibility that the PVP company could be given the team.<br /><br />\"We will discuss the entire issue now and see what can be done. It is now upto the Working Committee to take a final decision on the issue,\" the official said.<br /><br />Another top BCCI official expressed surprise that the bid of Rs 900 crore was rejected by Chargers.<br /><br />\"We are very surprised that a bid of Rs 900 crore plus has been rejected by Chargers. We thought that for a company that is in financial mess, the offer was a good one as it would have helped them clear their players' payment from the last edition. I guess they are being governed by the banks and that is the reason for rejecting the offer,\" the official said.<br /><br />On what will be the next step for the BCCI, he said, \"We need to wait till 5pm on September 15 when the timeframe of one month given to Deccan Chargers ends. If they don't pay the players' salaries, obviously the team would cease to exist. In any case they did a very wrong thing by mortgaging a BCCI property (IPL team) to the bank.\"<br /><br />According to IPL constitution, the BCCI has right to encash the bank guarantee and pay the players' salaries from it. There is a precedence when Kochi Tuskers Kerala team was disbanded and BCCI encashed the bank guarantee.<br /><br />Deccan Chronicle Holdings purchased the Hyderabad franchise for Rs. 428 crore in 2008. At the auction, the base price was said to be around Rs 750 crore.<br /><br />The winning bidder had to meet BCCI's eligibility criteria and other requirements. This was the first time an entire IPL franchise has been put on the block by its owners, although Rajasthan Royals sold a small stake in 2009 to the actress Shilpa Shetty and her husband Raj Kundra.<br /><br />According to the tender notice, which had appeared a few days' back in national newspapers, \"under this invitation to tender issued by DCHL, the winning bidder will acquire from the DCHL on an \"as is where is\" basis the right to own and operate the IPL team currently known as Deccan Chargers, which is and will continue to be based in Hyderabad and which competes in the Indian Premier League and which has the opportunity (if applicable and subject to qualification) to compete in each and any CLT20 which is staged from 2013 onwards\".<br /><br />The term \"as is where is\" means that the new buyer will have to use the name Deccan Chargers and will have to clear the liabilities of the current owner.<br /><br />According to the IPL constitution, 5 per cent of the bidding amount will be acquired by the BCCI.<br /><br />Earlier in June, DCHL had appointed investment banking institution, Religare to find a potential buyer but they were unable to find one, who would readily buy the team with its financial liabilities.",

He demanded that his suspension order be <br />revoked and disciplinary action taken against Narayana.<br /><br />Senior officers spoke to Sarma and appealed him to free the SP. Andhra Pradesh Home Minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy too spoke to him at one point and assured that his problems will be looked into and resolved, police said.<br /><br />Asked why he was holding the SP captive, Sarma told the news channel, \"It is only related to PTO issues. He is a high-ranking police officer in the organisation and complaints (against other officers) were made to him.\"<br /><br />Naryana, who was allowed by Sarma to speak to the channel, however, said he had never harassed Sarma and pleaded for release in view of his health condition.<br /><br />\"I have been tied here. My health is not good. I never harassed him. In fact, I came here (to the room) to solve his problem after Sarma asked me to do so. But after one hour, I was told that I have been held captive.\"<br /><br />What finally seemed to have persuaded Sarma to free the officer was the conversation he had with DGP V Dinesh Reddy.<br /><br />About 15 minutes after the DGP spoke to Sarma on phone, lights in the room were switched on, and both the SP and the head constable walked out of the room at around 11.05 PM, police said.<br /><br />\"The SP has been freed,\" Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anurag Sharma told PTI.<br />Mediapesons were not allowed near the spot.<br /><br />Reddy said the Head Constable highlighted certain points \"which were worth looking into\".<br /><br />\"I have spoken to him and asked him to directly meet me in office tomorrow. His issues will be handled on priority. I am going to inquire into why he was suspended. I asked him to release the SP,\" Reddy had said after the phone call.<br /><br />Asked if Sarma was arrested, the Commissioner said the head constable had not been taken into custody at the moment.<br /><br />The Commissioner, however, said police would certainly question the constable and find out what happened.<br /><br />Lakshmi Naryayana was taken to a nearby hospital after the release.",

The plant will come up in a 100 cubic metre site at the Rail Coach Factory premises,\" said a senior RCF official involved with the project.<br /><br />Railways has set a target of installing bio toilets designed by DRDO in 2500 coaches in the current fiscal. Besides Kapurthala, there will be two more anaerobic bacteria generation plants to be set up at Chennai and Nagpur.<br /><br />While bio toilets are being fitted in all new LHB coaches manufactured in RCF, conventional coaches will also be equipped with these toilets in a phased manner, said the RCF official.<br /><br />The anaerobic bacteria inside the toilets consumes waste material and converts it into water and gas in the bio-toilet system. The water passing through chlorine tank is discharged as clean water and the gas generated evaporates into the atmosphere.<br /><br />The RCF plant will produce about 10,000 litres of bacteria in 10 days. One toilet requires 150 litre of bacteria for 10 days. \"Currently we are procuring bacteria from DRDO but we have to generate on our own to meet the requirement for all coaches,\" he said, adding \"the plant will be operational in the near future.\"<br /><br />The bio toilet is estimated to cost about Rs 1 lakh per unit. \"It is odourless and it will also prevent corossion of rail tracks due to the open discharge of waste on rails,\" he said.<br /><br />The problem of environmental degradation and corrosion of tracks due to night soil has caught the attention of railways for a long time. Rail corrosion costs railways more than Rs 350 crore every year. Railways have successfully completed field trials using bio toilets in a few trains.<br /><br />\"We will equip 1200 coaches with bio toilets in the current fiscal,\" the official said. Railways have set up a core committee which is working out details to undertake retro-fitment in about 50,000 coaches of the national transporter.",

Restraint should be exercised so that nothing that divides our society and country is written, broadcast or telecast\", he said inaugurating golden jubilee celebrations of Kerala Union of Working Journalists.<br /><br />Singh's advice to the media against sensationalism came while referring to the recent violence in Assam and its reverberations in other parts of the country which saw exodus of north-easterners back to their home states.<br /><br />\"Today our country is going through difficult times. The unfortunate incidents of the past few months have brought out worrying faultlines in our society\", he said. Singh said the tragic developments in Assam and their reverberations in Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and other places have shown that \"We cannot afford to take social peace and harmony for granted\".<br /><br />He emphasised the need to be constantly vigilant and work continuously towards promoting greater communal harmony and inter-group and inter-community dialogue. Prefacing his advice to the media, he said, \"We are proud that freedom of expression is a constitutional guarantee in India. The media in our country is not just a reliable barometer of public opinion; it is also the conscience-keeper of our nation.\"<br /><br />Singh said India was a country with numerous religions, ethnicities, languages and viewpoints. \"Freedom for multiple, often opposing, viewpoints to co-exist is one of the defining characteristics of our society and polity. An independent and responsible media is a pre-requisite for sustaining such a society and polity,\" he said.<br /><br />He said the media in Kerala has both reflected people's aspirations and moulded public opinion. Malayalam dailies were replete with news of development activities long before the concept of development journalism evolved elsewhere in the country.<br /><br />\"I am told that recently there was a successful reality show by a Malayalam TV channel in which different panchayats showcased the development projects in their areas. It is indeed difficult to imagine such a show anywhere else in the country,\" he said.<br /><br />Noting that most of the old newspapers in Kerala were started as a part of the freedom movement, he said dailies like 'Deepika', 'Malayala Manorama' and 'Kerala Kamudi' have now been in publication for more than 100 years. Another daily 'Mathrubhumi' will soon cross the 100 years mark, he added.<br /><br />In the broadcast segment too, the state has more than ten channels with daily news bulletins, including five 24-hours news channels, Singh said, adding these facts show that the media plays an important role in the everyday life of the people.",

Now plans are afoot to maintain database of the repeat offenders,\" Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) C V Anand said.<br /><br />Though records of various other traffic violations are stored, now it will also include the database of offenders of drunken driving, which would be integrated with the hand-held PDA devices of the traffic personnel. This will enable to immediately know details on the kind of the repeated offence and pending fines, among other details, of such drivers, he said.<br /><br />\"Enforcement of steps against drunken driving will be further intensified with increased checking to bring down the road-crash related accidents and number of deaths. Besides, efforts are on to bring in more stringent measures against these offenders,\" the ACP said.<br /><br />\"We are asking for awarding of imprisonment for repeat offence and are working with the road transport officials seeking to cancel the driving licenses of such drivers, as the courts apart from imposing fines can also order for suspension of licenses,\" Anand said.<br /><br />\"During checking of drunk drivers, we are using a standard operating procedure and every team follows the same. Under provisions of Motor Vehicle Act, we use breath analysers and if the reading of Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) is found above the 30 mg per 100 ml blood, it is considered drunk driving,\" the official said. <br /><br />\"We don't arrest the person but detain their vehicles and ask them to come for counselling where we educate them on the dangers of drunken driving,\" Anand said. Such drivers undergo a detailed counselling session where video films are shown on the repercussions of driving under the influence of alcohol and other traffic violations. Also, an appeal is made to them to avoid drunk driving in future, he said.<br /><br />Those who attend the counselling session, have their challan stamped at the Traffic Training Institute, certifying that they have undergone counselling. Later, the drunk drivers are produced before a court which can fine them upto Rs 3,000.<br /><br />It has been found that majority of drunk drivers are in the age-group of 20-28 years and also teenagers, including women. Hence, now women police officials and constables will check them, he said.<br /><br />The Hyderabad traffic police officers are already being trained here as part of the global 'Road Safety 2010' project (RS10) by the WHO, which is being implemented in Jalandhar and the Andhra capital.<br /><br />To ensure effective enforcement of steps against drunken driving, high-tech equipment like breath analysers and digital still cameras are being provided to police for photographic evidence of traffic violations, Anand said.",

Pointing out that an efficient transport system was a service that was 'critical' to the orderly growth and development of cities, Singh said Metro rail was just one component of such a transport system.<br /><br />\"We need to build our cities with multimodal transport systems that efficiently integrate different modes of public transport like buses and trains. I understand that the Urban Development Ministry has taken several initiatives to promote sustainable transport practices in the country,\" he said.<br /><br />These include support to Metro rail projects, Bus Rapid Transit Systems and sanction of city buses under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). Singh said unless provisioning of services keeps pace with urbanisation, \"we will face serious problems of haphazard urban growth, slums and crumbling city infrastructure.\"<br /><br />At present, about 28 per cent people live in towns and cities which is expected to go up to 40 per cent by 2031, amounting to 60 crore people and contributing over 70 per cent of the GDP, he said.<br /><br />\"The high speed of urbanisation poses unprecedented managerial and policy challenges that we need to respond to.\" The Prime Minister said the Centre was also providing assistance for implementation of Bus Rapid Transit System projects in 11 cities with a network of over 437 km costing more than Rs 5,500 crore.<br /><br />Under JNNURM, the government has sanctioned over 15,000 low floor buses for mission cities totally costing over Rs 4,700 crore and committed over Rs 2,000 crore of assistance for the JNNURM buses, he said.<br /><br />Describing Kochi as one of the fastest growing urban agglomerations, Singh said it has emerged as one of the most important ports and was expected to evolve as an economic and logistical hub with the operationalisation of International Container Transhipment Terminal at nearby Valarpadam.

He facilitated the entry of five masked men into the aircraft with guns, knives and grenades and arranged finances for all this,\" an official said. <br /><br />Mehrajud-din was taking care of planning and finances. \"He was like the top boss giving directions and arranging logistics.\" On Dec 24, 1999, IC-814, with 176 passengers on board, was hijacked by five Pakistani militants and forced to land in three different airports -- Amritsar, Lahore, and Dubai - before being taken to Kandahar, the bastion of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. In Dubai, Rupin Katyal, one of the passengers, was fatally stabbed by the hijackers. <br /><br />The aircraft had to spend a week on the tarmac in Kandahar before terrorists were swapped for the hostages.",

These concerns and issues are things of the past.

Ottawa had snapped its nuclear ties with New Delhi after the latter had allegedly used plutonium produced in a Canadian reactor installed in the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay for its Pokhran-I nuclear test.<br /><br />Canada had supplied the nuclear reactor CIRUS to India in mid-1950s under the Atom for Peace programme for civilian use of nuclear energy. India had procured heavy water required for the research reactor from the US.<br /><br />However, after New Delhi secured a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers' Group in 2008, Canada was the fourth country - after US, Russia and France - to ink a civil nuke cooperation agreement with India.

Finally there would have been an erosion of India's credibility in the international field,\" Nath had said.<br /><br />\"What kind of a statement is this? It sounds to me more like an apology than a statement being made by a sovereign country. They don't even say if the proposed amendment was best in the interest of the Indian economy. We think it should have been the first thing they should have said. The statement is more apologetic than anything,\" Justice Alam said. It was then pointed out by the other counsel that the statement was corollary to the oppositions to the amendment in the patent law.<br /><br />The hearing, which remained inconclusive, is likely to resume on Thursday.<br />Meanwhile, a fresh affidavit filed by Novartis was objected to by the Cancer Patient Aid Association, engaged in a legal battle with the company which is marketing Glivec (Imatinib Mesylate in the beta crystalline form), a drug administered for treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.<br /><br />Senior counsel Anand Grover, appearing for the association, pointed out that the patient assistance programme run by the company to distribute Glivec free of cost or at a subsidised cost came with the condition that its product will not be subjected to \"regulatory price control.\"<br />",

Trivedi, an activist of India Against Corruption (IAC), was given bail Tuesday. The case has led to outrage in the country.<br /><br />\"I respect the law, but I do not respect a law that, even today, makes us feel as if we are not living in a free country,\" he said, addressing media persons here after his release.<br /><br />When asked if it was appropriate to draw a cartoon depicting 26/11 terrorist Ajmal Kasab urinating on the Indian Constitution, Trivedi maintained that he expressed things as he saw them, and there was no reason to think it was improper. He said he saw no need for an apology.  <br /><br />Trivedi slammed the sedition law under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, stating that the law was a colonial relic that was used by the British government to \"silence rebel voices\".<br /><br />\"This law should be repealed from our Constitution. It is the only law more misused than used. It is archaic and befitting a monarchy, not a democracy,\" he said.<br /><br />Trivedi was accompanied by social activist Dr Binayak Sen who was also charged with sedition and is still fighting the charge.

We will continue to fight this battle till the sedition charges under Section 124A (of Indian Penal Code) are dropped,\" he said, soon after emerging from the Arthur Road prison. <br /><br />Asked why he had earlier refused bail, Trivedi said that he wanted the government to drop the sedition charges against him first. <br /><br />\"I did not want to send out a message that I am not cooperating. But I also wanted the government to accept that they made a mistake by charging me with sedition. Hence I refused to accept bail,\" he said.<br /><br />\"However, I am not uncooperative and hence after IAC members talked me into it, I accepted the bail,\" he added.<br /><br />The Bombay High Court Tuesday granted bail against a bond of Rs.5,000 to Trivedi in a public interest litigation filed by lawyer Sanskar Marathe. <br /><br />Trivedi was arrested last Saturday and sent to police custody for seven days.<br />He was charged with sedition for drawing cartoons insulting Indian emblems, including the Constitution, during Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement in Mumbai Dec 2011.<br />Following nationwide outrage, Mumbai police Monday produced him before a court where he was remanded to judicial custody till Sep 24 but on Tuesday, he was granted bail by the high court.",

The only son of former Andhra Pradesh chief minister predicted that TDP would return to power in the 2014 elections. <br /><br />\"TDP alone has the strength to take on the Congress and it is the only party fighting for the people's cause,\" he said.

Naidu is embarking on an 117-day padayatra from Oct 2. He plans to cover 2,320 km, interacting with farmers and others to know their problems.<br /><br />While Naidu stays away from the state capital for nearly four months, his son is likely to run the party affairs. \"I will continue to work as a party worker. What is important is fighting for the people's problems,\" remarked Lokesh, when asked if he was going to assume a major role in the party.<br /><br />\"I worked in 2009 elections and also by-election,\" he said, while evading a direct reply whether or not he planned to contest next elections. For the last few years, Naidu has been trying to groom Lokesh as his successor.

Lokesh is married to Brahmini, the daughter of his maternal uncle N. Balakrishna, a popular Telugu film star and son of TDP founder N.T.

Harikrishna was keen to see his son Junior NTR, one of the leading actors of Telugu cinema, take the mantle.<br /><br />However, Junior NTR, who had campaigned for the party along with Balakrishna in 2009 elections, in July this year ruled out joining active politics for now.<br />",

The Prime Minister has constituted an inter-ministerial group headed by additional secretary in coal ministry Zohra Chatterjee to find lapses in the allotment and recommend steps and the report was awaited, he said.<br /><br />Action would be taken against any wrong doing and allotment cancelled if required, he said at the press meet at which AICC general secretary Dhaniram Shandil and Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Nabam Tuki, were also present.<br /><br />Noting that 39 blocks were allotted by the NDA government from 1999 to 2004 \"without following any guideline\" and 59 blocks by UPA during 2004 to 2008, he asked why the BJP was not demanding cancellation of 39 blocks allocated during the NDA regime or resignation of chief ministers of BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan besides Odisha. <br /><br />As there was no guideline for allocation of coal blocks, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wanted to regularise its allocation through auction and proposed amendment to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which was strongly opposed by Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, Narayansami said.<br /><br />He produced copies of letters of the then chief ministers of Rajasthan Vasundhara Raje, Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Jharkhand Arjun Munda, Odisha Naveen Patnaik and West Bengal chief secretary.<br /><br />He said a screening committee comprising chief secretaries of coal-bearing states and officials of the union coal ministry were formed to allocate coal blocks at a cheaper rate to private companies like Jindal, Tata, and Reliance besides PSUs on condition of supplying electricity at reasonable rates.<br /><br />\"The screening committee allotted blocks on the basis of recommendation by the state governments which are on record,\" he said. \"When the country is facing power shortage, the Prime Minister thought of this prudent step to be taken in consultation with the state governments in the larger interest of the people,\" Narayansami said.<br />\"Where is the loss?\" he questioned on the misgivings created by the BJP on the presumptive loss of Rs 1.86 lakh crore estimated by CAG.<br /><br />Pending amendment to the Act, the coal blocks were allotted by the screening committee in a transparent manner to overcome power crisis besides producing cement and steel, he said.<br /><br />He said the CAG was a constitutional body which submitted its report to the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament headed by a senior opposition leader, whose final report was binding on the government. \"But, the BJP politicised the CAG report even before the submission of report by the PAC.\"<br /><br />Coal extraction takes a minimum three to five years because of various procedures including environment and forest clearance, he said, adding investors had invested Rs 15 lakh crore.",

The Freedom of Expression was put to real threat during the Emergency when the media was muzzled and 1.5 lakh persons including politicians were jailed. One has to really wonder what is it that was not banned during the Emergency. To compare it with any other thing, in my opinion, is injustice,\" he told reporters.<br /><br />Yadav at the same time said the Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra acted \"foolish\" in the episode as seen in the decision to arrest the cartoonist on treason charges, which was not required because there is a law to deal with it.<br /><br />\"How can you say this was treason? Trivedi is young and did something out of enthusiasm,\" he said. \"To urinate in open is prohibited at many places. But will you jail all those who come from villages and are found doing it,\" he asked. The JD-U President said he had taken up Trivedi's matter with Maharashtra Home Minister R R Patil.<br /><br />Yadav, who is also the convener of the NDA, said though he is an opponent of the Emergency and had gone to jail then, but \"the fact is also that Indira Gandhi as the Prime Minister of the country showed exemplary courage in tackling the Punjab problem and during the Bangladesh War.\"<br /><br />\"I do not consider it proper to compare Emergency with everything every now and then,\" Yadav said. The JD-U President was replying to media queries on the post by Advani in his blog.<br /><br />Advani posted in his blog, \"I have always regarded the Emergency period 1975-77 as the worst in so far as suppression of civil liberties and freedom of expression were concerned. But seeing what has happened to political cartoonist and anti-corruption crusader Aseem Trivedi, I have started wondering is today's political set up worse even than the Emergency?\"",

Singh, however, indicated that his party would prefer to forge ties with the Left rather than the Trinamool Congress. <br /><br />\"Trinamool is a prominent regional party. When we speak to other parties, we will be under compulsion to also speak with Trinamool.  \"But the problem is that we have a traditional relation with the Left.

But is there anyone who does not want to be the prime minister?\"<br /><br />He was asked why his party so often came to the rescue of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance?

The defence also insinuated that Pain and his wife were better off now since they dodn't have to pay the boy's school fees anymore.<br /><br />On Sep 13, 2010, filmmakers Bedabrata Pain and Shonali Bose lost their elder son Ishan to a freak electrical accident. The boy was only 16. The couple fought a long and difficult court battle in a court in Los Angeles against the razor company the bereaved parents hold responsible accident.<br /><br />\"Yes, we lost the case. The jury couldn't come to the conclusion that the shaver was at fault. It was a shocking decision. But that's life. For me, it changes nothing. In going through the trial, and having had to review the evidence within the last two years, I was even more convinced that the razor had produced the spark that caused the fire that claimed Ishan's life,\" said for NASA scientist Pain, who has directed \"Chittagong\" based on the actual events of 1930 Chittagong Uprising.<br /><br />While Bedo, as his friends call him, has come to terms with the court's decision, his wife, who directed \"Amu\", is very angry.  \"She is campaigning for the product to be taken off the market. I understand her indignance. But I can't share it. Even if we had won the case what value could they've put on our boy's life? She is in Delhi with my son Vivan who is now studying there. It was getting very diffucult for my wife and son to stay in LA. So we're now in India for the next two years,\" Bedo said.<br /><br />The couple has temporarily moved to India with their younger son Vivan.  \"In some ways, I've made peace with the court verdict, though I am convinced more than ever that it was the razor that killed my son. But then now I ask myself, what would happen even if we won the case? It wouldn't bring Ishan back. <br /><br />\"I am going through very complicated emotions. I can't really express it. However the callousness of the razor company just makes me so sad. Even after we informed them of the tragedy, they didn't make even one attempt at investigation. Instead, they started making all kinds of allegations against Ishan,\" said Pain.<br /><br />Apparently it was alleged in the court that Ishan was on drugs and had deliberately set himself on fire. \"See, Ishan was a fantastic student and a really good boy. He never touched alcohol or cigarettes. They alleged that my boy was on drugs and set himself on fire. Can you believe this? Apparently kids in the US set themselves on fire after consuming some kinds of drugs. And this, mind you, when there was no evidence in the bathroom (where Ishan got burnt while shaving) of any fire-producing element anywhere.\"<br /><br />There was worse to come. The defence in the court actually insinuated that Bedo and his wife were better off now since they didn't have to pay Ishan's school fees. \"They asked during the trial how much was my son's annual school fees. Then they said, 'Okay, so during the last two years you didn't have to pay 58,000 dollars, right?' Believe it or not, they were saying we're better off since Ishan is not there. <br /><br />\"This is all on-record. These were the questions that my wife Shonali and I were asked. They then asked, 'How much did you spend on your son's clothes?...How much have your grocery bills come down by?'\"<br /><br />Bedo looks back on the journey since the bereavement with amazement.  \"I don't know what I would have done if I didn't have 'Chittagong' to make. I've dedicated 'Chittagong' to Ishan. Shonali and I wanted to cast Ishan as the main protagonist in 'Chittagong'. The character suited him. Finally, he didn't play the role. But he was the film's biggest supporter. No one could dare say anything bad about the film when he was around. The film ends with him. <br /><br />\"At the end I've sung a song titled 'Ishan' which Prasoon Joshi wrote. I had to sing for my boy.It fits in beautifully with the theme. Ishan in Bengali means that first storm in the summer that takes away all the decay and stagnancy. That's what my film is about. When Prasoon sent us the lines, I immediately decided to sing it. My composers Shankar Mahadevan encouraged me. He said no one had the right to sing it as much I did. I agree.\"<br /><br />Now there is a memorial screening of Chittagong for Ishan on Oct 3.  \"We wanted to do it on September 13 on Ishan's death anniversary. But we aren't ready. I'd like Mr. Amitabh Bachchan, Jayadi, Abhishek and Aishwarya to be present. <br /><br />\"When I had decided to make 'Chittagong', I had gone to Jayadi to seek her blessings. I am trying to live my life the way Ishan would have wanted me to. But it isn't easy. Someone up there decided to take my surname (Pain) too seriously.\"<br />",

Aware of the loss of livelihood following the seven-month prohibition from November 1 to May 31 on fishing in the sea, the government had earlier announced extension of PDS facilities for the affected fishermen families.<br /><br />\"We have identified more than 5,400 families who are entirely dependent on fishing. The identified families are either directly or indirectly affected by turtle conservation measures have been enumerated for PDS benefits,\" assistant director of marine fisheries, Paradip, Rabi Narayan Pattnaik said.<br /><br />The department has submitted a list to government agencies so that the affected people could avail of the subsistence package and alternate livelihood programme, he said.<br /><br />\"PDS benefits are yet to reach the targeted families, but we are hopeful the scheme will get underway shortly. The affected families are entitled to all PDS benefits including rice at Rs 2 a kg,\" he said. <br /><br />After prohibition was lifted on May 31, fishing is being disrupted due to frequent formation of low pressure. Rough sea has prevented fishing for fortnight-long spells in the past three months. Adding to their woes is dispute between exporters and trawler operators.     <br /><br />\"We are pinning hopes that subsidized PDS rice would provide relief during the lean season. We are feeling let down. The government should take the fishermen's livelihood issues more seriously,\" said Adikanda Roul, a fisherman.    <br /><br />It's pertinent to note that every year, the state government clamps a 7-month ban on fishing in a 20 km radius from Dhamara to the mouth of the Devi river. In accordance with the Odisha Marine Fisheries Regulatory Act, 1983, the prohibitory orders on fishing remains effective from November 1 to May 31.<br /><br />The legal embargo is to ensure the safety of breeding turtles who perish in large number either by getting entangled in fishing nets or by getting hit by propellers of trawlers.<br /><br />The prohibition in past years has resulted in a drastic drop in marine fish production and in economy of the region which is largely regulated by the sea fishing sector, said Tushar Sardar, the district wing president of Orissa Traditional Fish Workers Association. Ancillary sectors like ice-factories and net-making units in areas like Dhamra, Jamboo, Kharinasi, Ramnagar, Sandhakuda, Ambiki, Erasama and Paradipgada have closed down. <br /><br />Skilled boat-makers and net weavers from these areas are slowly shifting towards Digha and Vishakhapatnam due to bleak business prospects, he claimed.",

Eyewitnesses told IANS that PMANE co-ordinator S.P. Udayakumar and leader M. Pushparayan surfaced at Idinthakarai in the evening, following Udayakumar's earlier announcement that he would surrender to the police at Kudankulam around 9 p.m.<br /><br />However, in a dramatic turn of events, fishermen took away Udayakumar and Pushparayan in a boat. Their current whereabouts were not known. \"There is no news about the PMANE leaders surrendering. We are more concerned about maintaining law and order,\" George told IANS.<br /><br />Sixty-five people have been arrested over the last two days, following the violence and  over the Kundankulam project, he said. The year-long movement against the Kudankulam nuclear power project had turned violent Monday, leaving one agitator dead in police firing in Tuticorin district and several injured as police used batons to disperse the crowds. <br /><br />The protests, spearheaded by PMANE, and earlier confined to Kudankulam and Idinthakarai villages in Tirunelveli, had spread to Tuticorin following the clash with protesting fishermen on the beach at Kudankulam around 11.30 a.m. Monday.<br /><br />The situation in Tuticorin is now reportedly under control, said George. The situation erupted after plant officials announced that enriched uranium fuel would be loaded in the first of the two nuclear reactors around Sep 11.<br /><br />Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa had justified the police action. She also  announced compensation of Rs.5 lakh to the kin of the protester killed. India's atomic power plant operator Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) is building two 1,000 MW reactors with Russian help at Kudankulam since 2001.<br /><br />Villagers under the PMANE banner have opposed the project for the past one year, fearing for their safety, especially since the nuclear disaster at Fukushima in Japan March 2011.<br /><br />PMANE had decided to take its fight against the Rs.17,120 crore project near the plant and away from Idinthakarai village near Kudankulam.",

The letter states nothing about the deliberations by the GoM or the status of the proposed policy. Did they actually deliberate or the honourable ministers were meditating during the meeting?

Disposal of dead bodies is cheaper, in fact,\" the bench remarked.<br /><br />Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for AIDAN, submitted that the government failed to implement the court's direction to finalise a pharma policy, putting all essential and life-saving drugs under price control so as to make them affordable and accessible to all. He sought court's intervention to solve the problem.<br /><br />\"Do you want us to summon your ministers? You may not find it appropriate if we pass such orders or summon secretary-level officers for contempt of court. It was a decision to be taken by the cabinet and we find that the government is not willing to take a decision. We think we should pass an order bringing all 348 drugs under price-control policy,\" the court said.<br /><br />The court, however, put the matter for further hearing for September 27 after Luthra pleaded for a final opportunity to take a call on the policy.<br />",

The court said that 90 per cent Indians will not be able to afford the monthly treatment expense of Rs 1.2 lakh.<br /><br />\"Only people whose medicine bills are reimbursed can afford it,\" a bench of Justices Aftab Alam and Ranjana Prakash Desai remarked after being told about the price of \"wonder drug\".<br /><br />\"I was shocked to see the prices of these drugs in India.

    "content": "Recurring viral infections in early months of life can make babies prone to asthma attacks in the later stages of life, a new study has found. <br /><br />In a new finding, a husband-wife researcher duo of Indian origin claimed that repeated attacks by common virus known as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), could cripple a portion of a child's own immune system triggering asthma attacks in adulthood. Repeated infection breaches the natural protective barrier from breast milk.<br /><br />RSV is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection. It is one of the major causes of such infections among children in India accounting for almost one-third of cases. RSV is common in the US and Europe. Now experimenting with mice in the laboratory, Anuradha Ray and Prabir Ray from the University of Pittsburgh and their colleagues mapped the way how RSV infection in early years of life increased the risk of asthma in adults. <br /><br />\"The babies are the most vulnerable up to two years of age and there is no good vaccine against RSV,\" the couple told Deccan Herald in an email interview. Previous studies demonstrated newborns could be protected from developing allergies through proteins transferred in breast milk. Scientists had also shown how exposure of nursing mice to low doses of allergens protected the newborns from asthma.<br /><br />But the new research published in the September 9 issue of 'Nature Medicine' found that protection provided by breast milk wean away after some time if the virus continue to strike at the babies repeatedly. If breastfed newborn mice protected from asthma were repeatedly infected with RSV, they no longer exhibit the protective effect and become susceptible to asthma later in life.<br /><br />The virus overcomes the natural immune system by inducing an inflammatory response in the lung that impairs the function of a set of protective immune cells termed regulatory T cells, which in turn, produce inflammatory mediators to promote allergic responses. RSV cripples the function of those protective cells in such a way that they behave like pro-inflammatory cells.<br /><br />Asthma is caused when allergens irritate the airways of a person. As a result, the airways become tightened and inflamed producing lots of sticky mucous, which make breathing difficult. The new research explains the how and why of the attack. \"It is now well-accepted that in both humans and mice, regulatory T cells in our immune system suppress allergic and auto-immune diseases. We feel that the mechanism of virus-induced dysfunction of these regulatory cells identified in our study is also relevant in humans,\" the duo said.<br />",

    "content": "There will be no immediate hike in oil prices as the Congress party on Tuesday decided to take on board the coalition allies on the issue.<br /><br />However, the petrol prices may be hiked any time while the decision to increase the prices of diesel, cooking gas and kerosene would await the green signal from the allies, especially the Trinamool Congress, the DMK and the Nationalist Congress Party.<br /><br />The decision to defer the hike was taken at a meeting of the core committee, chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who returned from abroad after a medical check-up. Petroleum and natural gas minister S Jaipal Reddy is understood to have made a presentation on the current scenario clearing stating that the oil PSUs were incurring huge losses since international prices of crude were on the increase.<br /><br />The hike, especially in diesel and kerosene prices being a politically-sensitive issue, the committee preferred to discuss it with the allies as the Congress is wary of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee rocking the UPA boat as she has always opposed any hike in oil prices. The Congress is very hopeful of convincing the other key allies DMK and NCP.<br /><br />Still, raise only in petrol prices cannot be ruled out, Congress sources said, pointing out that the government had resorted to petrol price increase earlier too, without waiting for okay from the allies.<br /><br />At the core committee meeting, Reddy and finance minister P Chidambaram favoured a hike, while others favoured more consultation.<br /><br />Among others who attended the discussions included Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, ministers A K Antony, Sushil Shinde and Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel.<br /><br />A scheduled meeting of the Cabinet committee on Political Affairs, which was supposed to discuss the issue, was deferred as the government decided that it should be a political call and discussed first at the Congress party level. In his presentation before the core committee, Reddy was understood to have pointed out that the oil marketing companies were facing a loss to the tune of  Rs 1.88 lakh crore in the absence of a hike in prices. <br /><br />Reddy told the Congress leaders that currently, state-run Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil Corporation were losing around Rs 15 a litre on sale of diesel, Rs 6 on petrol, Rs 347 per cylinder and Rs 32.70 on a litre of kerosene.<br /><br />Reddy said the  decision will be taken sooner than later. He said a hike in the prices of administered fuel was unavoidable, but he was not sure when such a decision would come.<br /><br />\"If price hike is not taken up today, decisions may have to postpone by few days. However, I would like to tell the people (that) the increase in price is unavoidable. We will have to perform our unpleasant duty,\" Reddy said. Diesel price was last raised in June 2011 by Rs 3 a litre. During fiscal year 2011-12, the three OMCs lost Rs 1,38,541 crore in revenues on selling diesel, LPG and kerosene.<br /><br />To make it up, the government gave Rs 83,500 crore in cash assistance to the OMCs, while upstream firms like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) chipped in Rs 55,000 crore and the remaining was borne by OMCS themselves.<br /><br />This year the loss is estimated to be even higher as petrol prices, which were deregulated in 2010, haven't moved in tandem with the market price because of the government's efforts to keep inflation in check.",

Hence, guidelines on reporting cannot be framed across the board,\" wrote CJI Kapadia in a unanimous judgment.<br /><br />The court said accused or aggrieved persons have the right to approach a high court or the Supreme Court itself, if they feel they are being prejudiced by media coverage of a case. Previously accused or aggrieved persons could file defamation or contempt cases in instances of wrongful media coverage, depending on the circumstances. Tuesday's ruling is effectively another route through which relief can be sought against the media.<br /><br />The court reasoned that a court which has the power to punish for contempt, also has the power to postpone publication. The court said this was inherent in the powers of the judiciary in order to protect the proper administration of justice.<br /><br />The court also sought to cushion the media from the law of contempt through the ruling. \"Such measures protect the media from getting prosecuted or punished for committing contempt and at the same time such neutralising devices or techniques evolved by the courts effectuate a balance between conflicting public interests,\" the court said.<br /><br />The Bench, also comprising Justices D K Jain, S S Nijjar, J S Khehar and Ranjana Prakash Desai, said postponement orders could be a reasonable restriction on the freedom of speech and expression as given under Article 19(2) of the Constitution.<br /><br />The court said that such an order is not a \"punitive measure but a preventive one\".<br />\"The postponement orders fall under Article 19(2) and they satisfy the test of reasonableness,\" the Bench said, adding \"Courts are duty bound under inherent jurisdiction to protect the presumption of innocence (of accused) which is now recognised by this court as a human right under Article 21, subject to the applicant proving displacement of such a presumption in appropriate proceedings.\"<br /><br />The court said that the order for prohibiting publication was available as one of its inherent powers as provided under the Constitution.<br /><br />The court said, \"Such judicial law-making is part of the judicial process. Under Article 141, law-making through interpretation and expansion of the meanings of open textured expressions such as 'law in relation to contempt of court' in Article 19(2), 'equal protection of law', 'freedom of speech and expression' and 'administration of justice  is a legitimate function.\"<br /><br />The SC had earlier this year decided to determine the extent of media coverage of pending cases after leakage of some documents in a section of media in the case of Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Ltd and others versus Securities and Exchange Board of India and another. The bench, began hearing from March 27 after it received several complaints from lawyers about press coverage being untrue or prejudicing their clients. On May 3, the court reserved its verdict after hearing different parties including the Editors' Guild, Broadcast Editors Association and lawyers for Vodafone and the Sahara Group, amongst others.<br />",

They were demanding that KNPP's first 1,000 MW unit should not be loaded with enriched uranium fuel. The project is a joint venture between India and Russia.<br /><br />\"The overall situation is very calm and peaceful,\" Tirunelveli Superintendent of Police Vijayendra Bidari told Deccan Herald.

The Nuclear plant complex is well protected, said Bidari adding the police will soon detain PMANE chief S P Udayakumar and his close associates who have been steering the anti-KNPP protests for over a year now. Udayakumar is already wanted in nearly 200 cases and is the key accused in Monday's incidents in \"instigating\" violence at Kudankulam, Bidari said.<br /><br />Tension, however, mounted later in the evening at Idinthakarai coastal hamlet when Udayakumar addressed his supporters there.<br /><br />An unconfirmed report from Idinthakarai said social activist Arvind Kejriwal was on way and Udayakuamr and his close associates might surrender before the police in his presence.<br /><br />In his brief remarks to the media at Idinthakarai, Udayakumar condemned the police action on innocent fishermen who for nearly 400 days have been peacefully protesting against the nuclear project. <br /><br />Road-blocks put by protesters at Kudankulam and nearby villages have been removed and there is a \"cautious return\" to normalcy, an official said. But large number of fisherfolk in several coastal villages of Tuticorin and Kanniyakumari districts, including Manapadu near Tiruchendur where a fisherman Anthony was killed in the police firing on Monday, suspended fishing activities.

The minister's direction would imply negation of these agreements.<br /><br />\"Due to the above constraints the average utilisation of pilots in Air India was limited. Following the DGCA guidelines on FDTL would lead to optimum utilisation of its pilots and crew members.<br /><br />\"It would also reduce the requirement of pilots and cabin crew for a given number of aircraft and spare significant number of pilots and cabin crew members for additional aircraft which Air India is going to acquire up to 2015,\" the statement said.<br /><br />The Justice Dharmadhikari Committee Report on Air India's HR issues had also recommended that the pilots should abide by their licensing conditions and aviation rules.",

In February this year, the Maharashtra High Court had set aside the state government's decision to allot a large chunk of land for Ghai's institute.<br /><br />Ghai's Mukta Arts had proposed to set up the \"Whistling Woods Film Institute\" at Badhsa village in Haryana's Jhajjar district.

The court also ordered the panchayat to return an amount of over Rs 8 crore, with interest, which it had received from Ghai's company. The bench observed that the panchayat had illegally sold \"shamlat land (village common land)\" which did  not benefit the villagers.<br /><br />Nafe Singh, a 70-year-old retired school teacher of the village, had filed a public interest litigation in the court challenging the land deal.

(To) what extent can consumer take (it) is another matter,\" he told reporters after meeting Finance Minister P Chidambaram before the announcement of CCPA meeting being postponed was made.<br /><br />The double whammy of rising input cost (crude oil prices) and fall in value of rupee, which has made imports costlier, would mean that oil PSUs would end the fiscal with a huge Rs 1.88 lakh crore revenue loss on selling fuel below cost, he said.<br /><br />\"If it (price hike) is not taken up today, decisions may have to postpone by few days. <br /><br />However I would like to tell the people (that) the increase in price is unavoidable. We will have to perform our unpleasant duty,\" Reddy said.<br /><br />Diesel and cooking fuel rates have not been revised since June last year even as oil firms also sell deregulated petrol at a price which is almost Rs 6 a litre less than its cost.<br /><br />\"I can't say to what extent price rise will be. If I had the power it would had been done yesterday. I don't know if it will happen today or tomorrow or a week later,\" he said. <br /><br />Reddy said he had yesterday circulated an updated version of a note detailing the crisis created by the rise in crude oil prices and fall in value of rupee against the US dollar to members of the CCPA.<br /><br />Besides the Prime Minister and Chidambaram, the CCPA includes Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, Defence Minister A K Antony, NCP leader and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, Telecom Minister Kabil Sibal and Railway Minister Mukum Roy.<br /><br />\"We had circulated a note to all members of CCPA about the problem of increasing under-recoveries (revenue loss on fuel sales)... the under-recoveries will exceed Rs 1.88 lakh crore (this fiscal),\" he said. \"And prices (are) going up further at the global level; rupee is not softening.\"<br /><br />On his meeting with Chidambaram, Reddy said he had \"routine interactions\" on various proposals but declined to elaborate.<br /><br />\"We discussed the figures relating to under-recoveries,\" he added. PSU oil firms are losing a record Rs 560 crore per day on the sale of regulated diesel and cooking fuels, and another Rs 16 crore a day on petrol.<br /><br />They are losing about Rs 6 per litre on sale of petrol, a commodity which was freed from government control in June 2010 but whose rates haven't moved in tandem with the cost.<br /><br />They sell diesel at a loss of Rs 19.26 a litre, kerosene at Rs 34.34 per litre and domestic LPG at Rs 347 per 14.2-kg cylinder.<br /><br />\"I can't take decision (on raising prices) only on the basis of economic facts. We are operating in a political economy. We will have to take a balanced view,\" he said. <br /><br />While diesel prices have not been revised since June last year, petrol rates were last hiked in July. A decision on raising petrol price will be taken after the CCPA meeting on diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene.<br /><br />The ministry, in the note to CCPA, has been informed it about the three state-owned fuel retailers' borrowings to make up for the deficit. Their borrowings shot up to Rs 1,57,617 crore at end of June, from Rs 1,28,272 crore as on March 31.<br /><br />It also seeks to limit supply of subsidised LPG cylinders to 4-6 per household in a year. <br /><br />The ministry wants to bar households with income of more than Rs 50,000 per month or Rs 6 lakh in a year from getting subsidised LPG cylinders.<br /><br />As per the Oil Ministry's proposal, every household would get only 4-6 LPG cylinders at subsidised price of Rs 399 in Delhi and they will have to pay market price of Rs 746 per cylinder for any requirement beyond that.<br /><br />Besides considering raising diesel, domestic LPG and PDS kerosene rates, the CCPA may also consider a cut in the Rs 14.78 per litre excise duty currently levied on petrol.<br /><br />Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) reported a combined revenue loss of Rs 47,811 crore on fuel sales in the first quarter. Of this, upstream firms like ONGC made good Rs 15,061 crore by the way of discount of crude oil they sell to them.<br /><br />The oil ministry sought cash subsidy for the remaining Rs 32,750 crore but the Finance Ministry has not released any.<br /><br />In the absence of the subsidy support, IOC reported the highest quarterly net loss by any Indian company at Rs 22,451 crore.

    "content": "A meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA), which could have decided on raising diesel and cooking fuel prices, was today postponed even as Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy said the price increase was \"unavoidable\".<br /><br />CCPA, which is headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and includes ministers from allies of the UPA alliance, was scheduled to meet this evening but it was postponed without assigning any reason or fixing a new date.<br /><br />Reddy said although the increase in diesel, cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene prices was not listed on the agenda, CCPA could have discussed the issue based on the revised note on the subject that his ministry had circulated to its members yesterday.<br /><br />\"As I said before, however painful and difficult the increase in price of oil product may be, increase is unavoidable. (To) what extent can consumer take (it) is another matter,\" he told reporters after meeting Finance Minister P Chidambaram before the announcement of CCPA meeting being postponed was made.<br /><br />The double whammy of rising input cost (crude oil prices) and fall in value of rupee, which has made imports costlier, would mean that oil PSUs would end the fiscal with a huge Rs 1.88 lakh crore revenue loss on selling fuel below cost, he said.<br /><br />\"If it (price hike) is not taken up today, decisions may have to postpone by few days. <br /><br />However I would like to tell the people (that) the increase in price is unavoidable. We will have to perform our unpleasant duty,\" Reddy said.<br /><br />Diesel and cooking fuel rates have not been revised since June last year even as oil firms also sell deregulated petrol at a price which is almost Rs 6 a litre less than its cost.<br /><br />\"I can't say to what extent price rise will be. If I had the power it would had been done yesterday. I don't know if it will happen today or tomorrow or a week later,\" he said. <br /><br />Reddy said he had yesterday circulated an updated version of a note detailing the crisis created by the rise in crude oil prices and fall in value of rupee against the US dollar to members of the CCPA.<br /><br />Besides the Prime Minister and Chidambaram, the CCPA includes Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, Defence Minister A K Antony, NCP leader and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, Telecom Minister Kabil Sibal and Railway Minister Mukum Roy.<br /><br />\"We had circulated a note to all members of CCPA about the problem of increasing under-recoveries (revenue loss on fuel sales)... the under-recoveries will exceed Rs 1.88 lakh crore (this fiscal),\" he said. \"And prices (are) going up further at the global level; rupee is not softening.\"<br /><br />On his meeting with Chidambaram, Reddy said he had \"routine interactions\" on various proposals but declined to elaborate.<br /><br />\"We discussed the figures relating to under-recoveries,\" he added. PSU oil firms are losing a record Rs 560 crore per day on the sale of regulated diesel and cooking fuels, and another Rs 16 crore a day on petrol.<br /><br />They are losing about Rs 6 per litre on sale of petrol, a commodity which was freed from government control in June 2010 but whose rates haven't moved in tandem with the cost.<br /><br />They sell diesel at a loss of Rs 19.26 a litre, kerosene at Rs 34.34 per litre and domestic LPG at Rs 347 per 14.2-kg cylinder.<br /><br />\"I can't take decision (on raising prices) only on the basis of economic facts. We are operating in a political economy. We will have to take a balanced view,\" he said. <br />",

Trouble began when some IAC supporters, including women, tried to disrupt the press conference by asking questions on coal block allocations. \"After that, Congress workers asked them to leave but they refused and shouted slogans against the minister and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. This led to a clash with Congress workers,\" a police official said.<br /><br />IAC supporters were dragged out of the posh hotel where the media interaction was being held. They protest outside the hotel, demanding action against Congress workers, who had allegedly assaulted and abused them.<br />",

This item (increase in diesel and cooking fuel) is not listed,\" he told reporters after meeting Finance Minister P Chidambaram here. \"I am not sure if the item will be taken up at all today.\"<br /><br />Reddy said he had yesterday circulated an updated version of a note detailing the crisis created by rise in crude oil prices and fall in value of rupee against the US dollar to members of the CCPA, which is headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. \"I have tried to acquaint the members of CCPA about this matter... As I have said before, painful and difficult decisions on price of oil products will have to be taken. Increase in price is unavoidable,\" he said.<br /><br />Reddy added that if the CCPA does not discuss the fuel price issue today, it would be taken up at the next meeting of the Cabinet committee which takes decision that have wider political ramifications.<br /><br />He said a decision on raising prices would have to be taken not just on economic facts but also taking into account the how much the consumers can absorb. \"We have to take a balanced view.\"<br /><br />\"If (price increase) is taken up today (by CCPA), which is not very likely, some decisions may be taken... if it is not taken up today, decision will be postponed,\" he said.<br /><br />Asked about the quantum of hike in rates that is likely, he said, \"I can't say to what extent (the price would be increased).

We are in discussion with the Commerce Ministry to allow wheat, rice and sugar exports at certain level,\" he said.<br /><br />The stable policy on export will help both farmers and industry, he added. Thomas also noted that the present export policy on wheat, rice and sugar will continue.<br /><br />The country has exported 3.15 million tonnes of sugar so far this year. Besides, about 2.5 million tonnes of wheat and more than 4 million tonnes of non-basmati rice have been shipped since September 2011, when the export ban on these two items was lifted.<br /><br />On decontrol of the sugar sector, Thomas said, \"We have been conscious about the need to revisit regulatory norms  on the sugar sector. The Rangarajan Committee on sugar decontrol has finalised the report and will very soon submit to the Prime Minister.\"<br /><br />Once the report is approved, it will be ready for implementation, he added. The sugar sector is the only industry which is fully controlled by the government. It is regulated right from the production of sugar through distribution in domestic and global markets.<br /><br />On sugar production for next year, Thomas said, \"We are likely to produce enough sugar to meet the consumption demand and will perhaps have a small exportable surplus.\"<br /><br />However, the government will formulated the first estimate on sugar output end of this month in consultation with state sugar commissioners, he added. The country's sugar economy is approximately USD 16 million and impacts 50 million farmer families.<br /><br />India is estimated to have produced 26 million tonnes in the ongoing 2011-12 marketing year (October-September), as against the annual demand of 22-23 million tonnes.",

Schools and shops have opened, normalcy is slowing in the area, Trinuveli District Collector R. Selvaraj told IANS Tuesday.  <br /><br />Around 20 people were on fast for 48 hours at Idinthakarai village in Tirunelveli, around 650 km from here, against the Kudankulam nuclear project.  We are worried about whereabouts of PMANE (people movement against nuclear energy) leaders, S.P. Udayakumar and M. Pushparayan, Selvaraj said.<br /><br />Since they are hiding in a boat, we are trying to locate them, he said. Officials of the AERB (Atomic Energy Regulatory Board) are at the nuclear plant doing the final studies, Selvaraj added.<br /><br />The over a year-long protests against the Kudankulam nuclear project in Tamil Nadu turned violent Monday, leaving one agitator dead in police firing in Tuticorin district and several injured in a police baton charge on protestors near the plant in Tirunelveli district.<br /><br />The protests, spearheaded by PMANE, and earlier confined to Kudankulam and Idinthakarai villages in Tirunelveli, spread to Tuticorin following the baton charge on the protesting fishermen on the beach at Kudankulam around 11.30 a.m. Monday.<br /><br />Protesting against the baton charge, an around 400-strong crowd attacked a police check post in Manapaddu village in Tuticorin village. A protestor was shot dead in defensive fire by a policemen, after his other three colleagues, including a woman constable, were injured. <br /><br />The violence comes as plant officials announced that enriched uranium fuel would be loaded in the first of the two nuclear reactors around Sep 11. For the first time since the protests began, a large police contingent entered Idinthakarai village in Tirunelveli district, which has served as the hub of the protest.<br /><br />A resident of the village had told IANS that around 300 policemen were in the village. It was from this village that the protesters charted their plans after the state government gave its green signal to the project last year. <br /><br />The government had earlier asked the central government to allay the fears of the public before carrying out construction work. Justifying the police action, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, in a statement, had said the protesters tried to advance towards the nuclear power plant despite police officials asking them to disperse as the prohibitory orders have been issued.<br /><br />\"The protestors not only attempted to move closer to the Kudankulam atomic power plant but also attacked police with logs injuring some policemen. In self-defence and also to protect the public if they attack the nuclear power plant, police fired tear gas shells,\" Jayalalithaa had said.<br /><br />She had also appealed to the protesters to extend their cooperation for the early commissioning of the reactor which is most safe. The chief minister had also announced compensation of Rs.5 lakh to the kin of the protester killed in Tuticorin.<br /><br />India's atomic power plant operator Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) is building two 1,000 MW reactors with Russian help at Kudankulam since 2001. Villagers under the PMANE banner have opposed the project for the past one year, fearing for their safety, especially since the nuclear disaster at Fukushima in Japan March 2011.<br /><br />The PMANE had decided to take its fight against the Rs.17,120-crore project near the plant and away from Idinthakarai village near Kudankulam. Around 8,000 people including women and children from eight villages near Kudankulam assembled at the beach since Sunday morning to stage their protest despite the prohibitory orders.<br /><br />Around 4,000 policemen were deployed around the plant site, and senior police officials also rushed to the spot.<br />",

It is the jewel in the crown of India's private coaching industry, a $6.4 billion business that exacerbates the social divide.<br /><br />Cram schools have become a magnet for tens of thousands of mostly middle class families in a country where two decades of rapid economic growth have failed to improve a dysfunctional state education system and a shortage of good universities.<br /><br />Such cram schools coach students for fiercely competitive entrance tests to a handful of premier technical and medical colleges. Their modus operandi is rote learning. At Bansal's, hundreds of teenagers are trained intensively to solve complex multiple-choice questions on physics, chemistry or mathematics.<br /><br />Yash Raj Mishra, a Kota cram student, lives in a tiny room with no television or laptop and spends almost 16 hours a day attending classes, revising or tackling question papers.<br /><br />\"Physics is my first and last girlfriend,\" said Mishra, leaning against a wall plastered with notes on Kinematics.<br /><br />\"I feel bad and frustrated when my friends score even slightly better than I do,\" added the 17-year-old, who calls his friends only to ask about their academic progress.<br /><br />Two-year coaching programmes in Kota cost $3,000-$4,000, in addition to which students have to pay for their regular schools and spend at least $2,000 a year on accommodation. That makes the total expenditure a small fortune for most in a nation where the annual per capita income is around $1,250.<br /><br /><br /><br />\"A child is a stack of thousand-rupee notes,\" said Manoj Chauhan, a mathematics tutor in his late 20s who could have joined a software company or multinational but chose instead to teach in Kota, where many teachers' salaries top $6,000 a month.<br /><br />Such cram schools compound the inequalities of an education system plagued by absentee teachers and high drop-out rates, which have left a quarter of Indians illiterate and lacking the skills to match the country's growing economic needs.<br /><br />A global survey by ManpowerGroup, one of the world's largest staffing service providers, estimated India's shortage of skilled labour at 67 percent - the second worst in the world.<br /><br />The skill shortages threaten to blunt what is seen as one of India's biggest economic advantages - its demographic dividend.<br /><br />With 60 percent of India's 1.2 billion population under the age of 35, the country has an opportunity to reap the kind of demographic dividend that brought the dramatic transformation of East Asian economies towards the end of the 20th century.<br /><br />The average age of an Indian in 2020 will be 29 compared with 37 in China and the United States and 48 in Japan, bringing a chance to boost productivity and the savings rate. But India may never realise its dividend if the bulk of these youths are poorly educated, stuck in low-value jobs or under-employed.<br /><br />RITE OF PASSAGE<br /><br />Every year more than 50,000 students from across the country enroll in Kota, many of them under parental pressure. The riverside town has become the capital of the multi-billion-dollar coaching industry, thanks to the success of Bansal Classes, which was set up by a former engineer who held the first classes across the table in his own dining room.<br /><br />The city of nearly one million has flourished partly because of its blandness, with parents seeing the relative lack of distractions for students a bonus. Despite housing thousands of teenagers, it has hardly any of the shopping malls and cinema complexes that sprouted across the country as the economy grew.<br /><br />The goal of attending cram schools is cracking the tough exams set by top colleges such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) or the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), whose degrees can be a ticket to a lifetime of fat pay cheques or jobs in the United States.<br /><br />\"There were 50 children who committed suicide in Kota last year,\" said Vinod Kumar Bansal, founder of Bansal Classes. \"When a child realises he can't make it to IIT, the guilt of spending his father's money on coaching can lead him to end his life.\"<br /><br />Bansal founded the school in the 1980s, leaving his job at a nylon-making firm after being diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, and it was his success that bred Kota's coaching juggernaut.<br /><br />The centre shot to fame after a string of successes in getting students admitted to India's toughest colleges - spawning a host of other institutions that were inspired by Bansal's success. Its website says 16,000 of its students have gained admission to IITs, more than any other cram school.<br /><br />In 2012, more than 500,000 students took the IIT entrance exam and less than 10,000 cleared it, making admission statistically harder than getting into America's Ivy League colleges.<br /><br />Today Bansal's school, whose eight storeys are connected by wheelchair ramps, has become a thriving business with annual earnings close to 1 billion rupees - and that despite a sharp slowdown in India's economic growth.<br /><br />\"In the long run, it has to undermine faith in the education system as a meritocratic system, where hard work and talent are rewarded,\" said Chad Lykins, co-author of an Asian Development Bank report on private coaching in Asia. \"Instead, the reward goes to the person who can go outside the system and get exam tricks and tips.\"<br /><br />Critics also argue that the cram schools offer false hope to many students and parents, promising results even though the candidate may not have an aptitude for engineering or medicine.<br /><br />\"Actually in a coaching institute you are treated like a rat,\" said Ashutosh Banerjee, who fled Kota within a month after getting fed up with his cram school. \"Teachers have a lot of attitude and they shout at everyone and make fun of everyone.\"<br /><br />But for most students, the teachers are above reproach and can become mini celebrities in Kota, where their pictures are plastered on city walls.<br /><br />\"On streets, students point at me or stare,\" said Chauhan, the maths tutor, who has billboards with his picture around the city. \"They have made videos and uploaded on YouTube.\"<br /><br />RAT RACE<br /><br />Seeing the potential in the Indian market, Etoos, a South Korean coaching giant, invested 300 million rupees to set up shop in Kota in 2011, focusing on video lectures and e-learning.<br /><br />\"In terms of revenue, India is going to cross over South Korea,\" said Etoos' business head Nitin Chaturvedi. \"The Indian population is huge and geographically also it is 4-5 times of Korea.\"<br /><br />Coaching firms have flourished in other cities too. FIITJEE, a household name for would-be engineering students, has over 60 franchises across the country. It plans an initial public offering (IPO) in the next few months.<br /><br />\"People are chasing us like anything,\" said R. Trikha, head of distance learning at FIITJEE. \"Coaching is actually there because the school systems are not doing their job. Society should be grateful to us that we are fulfilling this need.\"<br /><br />But the popularity of India's cram schools has helped make a bad situation worse in the state education system. Better pay tempts schoolteachers to moonlight as private instructors, neglecting the poorer students they are meant to be teaching.<br /><br />\"It is forbidden, but enforcement is another issue,\" said Anshu Vaish, secretary at the Ministry of Education. \"Typically, what teachers do often is that they won't teach in the classroom and they will make students come to their homes later to study the same thing.\"<br /><br />The poor quality of state teaching has resulted in a generation where about two-thirds of 10-year-olds cannot do a simple division problem, according to Wilima Wadhwa of ASER, a Delhi-based education research centre.<br /><br />The experience in poorer schools can be bleak. Teacher truancy is common in most villages, while poverty can force families to pull children out of school early to find work. Pupils from lower castes face bullying and discrimination from their teachers, and are sometimes forced into doing menial jobs such as cleaning school toilets instead of attending classes.<br /><br />The lack of good schools and colleges means that the quality of the average Indian degree is so low that even those students who manage to get one could find themselves without a job.<br /><br />\"Only 25 percent of our engineering graduates, on average, are actually fit to fulfill the requirements of the IT industry,\" said Binod Khadria, a sociology professor at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University. \"So you can imagine the amount of wastage. Those who are left over ... what are they going to do?\"",

Is it solely a coincidence or there is more to it,\" Congress spokesperson  Manish Tewari told reporters here.<br /><br />The CAG in a recent report said that private players had windfall gains  worth Rs.1.85 lakh crore in the 142 coal blocks allocated by the  Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government 2006-09.<br /><br />\"Is the CAG misusing its credibility... If it is so, the question is why,\" Tewari asked. The BJP did not allow parliament to function during the monsoon session by demanding Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's resignation over the issue and  cancellation of the allocated coal blocks.<br /><br />Tewari said it was unfortunate that another session of parliament had been washed out and said that it was the responsibility as much of the CAG as of the BJP. \"In the past 22 months, the CAG has been tossing presumptive, hypothetical and at times even mythical figures in the public domain which has made the  public discourse toxic and which has created road blocks for governance and which has unnecessarily tarred the India story,.\" he said.<br /><br />According to Tewari, while in the 2G matter, the Supreme Court did cancel  the 122 licenses, it was equally true that the apex court refrained from making any observation with regard to the Rs. 1.76 lakh crore presumptive  loss computed by the CAG.<br /><br />Replying to a question whether a parallel can be drawn between the former CAG TN Chaturvedi and the incumbent Vinod Rai, Tewari said history, if  repeats itself once is a tragedy, if it does so twice, it is a farce.<br /><br />\"All that I would like to say at this moment is that the trajectory of coincidence is uncanny.\" He said a senior BJP leader had telephoned a CAG official before the report was tabled in parliament and asked the opposition party to dismiss the fact if it could.<br /><br />He said the BJP did not allow the parliament to function but when it came to states ruled by it, the party adopted different standards with regard to the CAG report.<br />",

Traders, however, said the cap of 137 items on export through road via Attari needs to lifted. Cost of transporting goods by road is one-third of the expenses for transporting goods to Pakistan by sea. The sea route is open for most of the 6,000 items being traded between the two countries.<br /><br />Rajdeep Uppal, president of the Amritsar Exporters Chamber of Commerce said: \"Most of the export items go to Pakistan by the sea route where restriction does not apply. Pakistan allows India to export just 137 items via land route. It's a limiting factor,\" he said. As per estimates, in 2007, annual trade between India and Pakistan through road was worth Rs 6.5 billion only. By 2010-11, the figure rose to Rs 15 billion.<br /><br />Trade with Pakistan through road via the Attari border has undergone significant changes in the last few years. Until a few years ago, trucks weren't allowed anywhere near the border posts. Porters from both nations carried heavy export-import stocks on their backs to the other side. After trade regulations were eased, especially after the integrated check post became operational, around 500 trucks cross the border everyday, as against the earlier traffic of about 150 trucks. <br /><br />India exports several items by road including vegetables, frozen meat, soybean products and cotton yarn and imports dry fruit and cement from Pakistan. Both countries import and export chemicals.<br /><br />Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said relaxation in norms will boost trade and social ties. \"I personally advocate a free trade regime between the two countries. <br /><br />\"The government should also consider opening other trade routes from Fazilka and Ferozepur,\" he said, adding that Punjab could become a gateway to central Asian countries and such trade links will change the economic profile of the entire state. <br />",

But as the Science and Technology Minister Vayalar Ravi entered Parliament, a group of MPs caught hold of him in the Lok Sabha lobby and lodged their strong opposition to the bill. Swayed by the opposition from parliamentarians, which also included a few from the ruling Congress party, Ravi decided to withdraw the bill.<br /><br />\"The bill may be introduced in the House but only after discussing it with the MPs. We will take their concerns into account,\" Ravi said here on Monday, when asked to comment on the government's decision to withdraw at the last moment. Many Parliamentarians and activists apprehend that the authority will fast pace introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops and other products in the country even without having a stringent regulatory mechanism in place. They are also against a provision in the bill, which allows Department of Biotechnology (DBT) to have a say while deciding regulatory policy on GM crops in India. <br /><br />DBT being the department for promoting biotechnology, they say, there is a conflict of interest.<br /><br />DBT officials on their part told Deccan Herald that they are open to put the BRAI under some other administrative ministry like the ministry of agriculture \"but DBT secretary should be kept out of its ambit\". But they would prefer to make those changes once the bill is introduced in the House and sent to the House panel for review.<br /><br />Redrafting of the legislation from the beginning would be time-consuming for a sector where there is a crying need for an independent regulator.<br /><br />Bright future<br /><br />At the current rate of growth of 20 per cent, Indian biotechnology sector is poised to be a $20 billion industry by 2020. Regulation is required because of the sector's potential to bring revolutionary changes in health care and agriculture sectors.<br /><br />The government appears to be accommodative of the parliamentarians demand for creating a select committee to look at the contentious bill rather than going through the standard Parliamentary Standing Committee route.  <br /><br />\"Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi were petitioned by the MPs against the controversial provisions in the bill\", Ravi said. <br /><br />The bill was listed for introduction in the Lok Sabha last year also but it was withdrawn following objections from MPs.<br /><br />To be mandated to carry out scientific risk assessment in a transparent way, BRAI seeks to separate the commercialisation process from risk assessment and will not erode the right of states in approving or rejecting a biotech product.<br /><br />In its present form, the bill received flak from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture too, which cautioned the government to put in place sufficient checks and balance after reviewing the entire GM research scenario.<br />",

But, when it comes to other names such as Janardhana Reddy, the jailed mining baron, there are no details as to which company he headed. It just says&amp;hellip; 'K Janardana Reddy - Partner'. Even the initial is wrong as it is 'G', not 'K'.<br /><br /> Same is the case with various other individuals and firms. For instance, in the of Congress Rajya Sabha member Anil H Lad and his family owned firm VSL Mining Company Pvt Ltd, Lad is shown as Managing Director, and no details including the address of his company is given. It is, however, likely that the CID might be have given the details in the chargesheet, the report it submitted to the court contains hardly any details. The daily dairy of the accused officers of various departments should have been the part of the report, legal experts say. <br /><br />Worse, the CID report, submitted to the Supreme Court after the CEC submitted its preliminary report to the court in April this year, fails to explain the action taken by the government against the accused since the Lokayukta submitted its report on the mining scam in July 2011. <br /><br />Seized property<br /><br />Although the CID submitted before the apex court that the investigation has revealed that total quantity of 9.10 lakh metric tons of iron ore were seized on March 20, 2010 and 7.57 lakhs mt was exported illegally by the accused, details given are sketchy. The port conservator had failed to protect the seized property, instead, he allowed the exporters to dispose the ore, the CID report says. <br /><br />Though the CID is conducting its investigation since June 2010, it is yet to file chargesheets in many cases. For example, it says it intends to file an additional chargesheet against the Capt C Swamy, then port officer of Karwar, as the investigation has been completed. But it has not yet completed the process.  <br /><br />Referring to the permits issued by the Department of Mines &amp; Geology, the CID report says that of the 42 lessees of iron ore pits in seven districts, only 14 have furnished the details sought by the CID. As many as 28 lessees are yet to comply with the norm. Of the 41 stock yard holders, 12 have submitted the details, while 29 are yet to furnish the details, the report says. <br /><br />While not explaining what the government did after the scam came to light, the CID says that &quot;there may have been violation&quot; of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999; Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 and the Customs Act, 1962; Mines &amp; Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act and other relevant provisions of law. These aspects will be investigated, it says. <br /><br />However, the state agency is now off the investigation, as the CBI will take over the probe.<br />",

This is what was told to me in the meeting,\" Shinde remarked to a question on creation of a new state in South India.<br /><br />Already nine states, including Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Odisha, are witnessing scaled up Maoist problems that had forced the prime minister to dub left wing extremism as the biggest internal security threat.<br /><br />Justice Srikrishna Committee, in its report submitted to the MHA in January, had recommended six options on Telangana.

That part of the report has not been made public so far, sources said.<br /><br />For long public protests in Andhra Pradesh for a separate state of Telangana was suspected to have been aided by Naxal sympathisers, security agencies had said.<br /><br />The home minister, however, claimed that the Telangana issue will be resolved by the UPA government but said no decision was taken to convene all party meeting on Telangana. His predecessor P Chidambaram had earlier said the government will call an all party meeting to know their views on the sensitive political issue.<br /><br />No time frame to resolve issue: Azad<br /><br />AICC general secretary and state in-charge of Andhra Pradesh, Ghulam Nabi Azad, has taken political circles in the state by surprise with his announcement that the Centre has not set any time frame to resolve the Telangana issue, reports DHNS from Hyderabad.<br /><br />The statement comes amid TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao camping in New Delhi, confident of an announcement on Telangana by September 20. Azad said here that he was not aware of any positive signals from the Centre, contrary to Rao's claim.",

However, this time, it was a swarm of bees which did the foul play.<br /><br />It began with some flight staff noticing a humming sound in the cargo section of the aircraft of Patna bound Indigo flight 6E-339 which was supposed to take off at 9.20 am.<br /><br />The fire brigade was summoned immediately. It was found that bees had entered the engine room which might cause serious problem not only for the passengers but also to the flight itself and so the flight was immediately put on hold, an airport official said.  \"The passengers were seated in their seats and two fire engines, supported by the ground staff, drove the creatures away from the flight after an effort of nearly 40 minutes,\" an Indigo official said.<br /><br />\"As the bees entered the engine room, it was not impossible to use water there. Instead, we had to use Carbon Dioxide and we had to be careful because excess use of this gas might cause problem for the passengers. Ultimately, we were successful in driving the bees out of the aircraft,\" a Fire Brigade official said.<br /><br />The passengers, who were unaware of the bees' presence in the beginning, had some panic moments when they came to know about the exercise in the cargo and engine room.<br /><br />\"The flight was about to take off and then suddenly it came to halt. Though the flight staff repeatedly told us not to be worried, we were little scared. Ultimately, after the bees were driven off, we were told about the incident. There was flurry of laughter all around the aircraft,\" Amitava Biswas who was on the flight, told Deccan Herald.<br /><br />The flight finally took off at 10.05 AM, sources said, adding that none of the passengers were stung by the bees.<br /><br />\"As extension work of the airport is going on, we have chopped off the trees which had been a natural habitat for these creatures. As they have nowhere else to go, they entered the aircraft,\" a senior airport official noted.",

But where the mineralisation is not known, it is difficult to auction.

PTI Photo\" width=\"250\" /> Earlier in the day, riot police used tear gas and resorted to lathi-charge to disperse anti-KNPP activists. <br /><br />Tension had been mounting in the area after about 4,000 anti-KNPP protesters under the banner of 'People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy (PMANE) led by S P Udayakumar, moved out of the Church premises from Idinthakarai coastal hamlet, 3 km north of Kudankulam, to the beach some 500 metres behind the N-plant, since Sunday afternoon. It touched a flash point on Monday morning, as they again tried to march towards the N-plant, official sources told Deccan Herald. <br /><br />The police action sparked strong protests by fishermen in the neighbouring districts of Kanniyakumari and Tuticorin. At Kulasekarapattinam in Tuticorin district, a fisherman, Anthony, was killed when Police opened fire against a violent mob tried to attack a Police station there. In some places, fisherfolk also staged 'rasta-roko' and blocked trains.<br /><br /> Activists and sympathisers, largely fisherfolk, were demanding that the KNPP authorities stop immediately all activities related to fuel loading in the first 1,000-MWe reactor, scheduled in the coming fewdays. The Madras High Court had dismissed all the PILs against the commissioning of the plant. The agitators said they would move the Supreme Court against the order.<br /><br /> Police and other authorities were \"surprised and stunned\" when the protesters began marching towards the plant on Sunday and again on Monday morning in a bid to lay siege to the KNPP.  This time they used different route and came almost 500 metres close to the plant. Few fishermen even tried to ride a boat into the two- km prohibited zone from the sea side.<br /><br />The protesters stayed on the beach whole of Sunday night, despite Police officials led by South Zone IG Rajesh Das and Tirunelveli District SP Vijayendra Bidari kept telling the crowd to leave the place.<br /><br /> \"The police did not want any confrontation; but a sudden provocation came from the protesters when some fishermen started attacking the police with stones and sticks,\" an official who did not want to be named said.  <br /><br /> As the protesters advanced, the police started lathi-charge and burst tear gas shells. Protesters, including women and children, ran helter skelter and some even jumped into the sea. Several police men including IG's gunman, were injured.<br /><br /> While some protesters were detained amid reports that a large number of fisher folk were kept in 'kalyana mandaps' to ease the tension, sources said. Udayakumar and his close associates have been \"safely rowed away\" in a boat by some fishermen to an unidentified place, the sources added. Over 150 cases have already been filed against the PMANE chief Udayakumar and his close aides. The \"overall situation is under control, but some villages near Kudankulam are tense,\" the sources said. Small groups of anti-KNPP protestors were on the prowl at different places, placing stones on roads to cut off vehicular movement towards the villages. An unruly mob torched few vehicles, ransacked the Kudankulam Panchayat Office and burnt some records, the sources added.<br /><br />Leaders of various political parties including P Nedumaran of MDMK, Thol Thirumavalavan (VCK),and PMK founder, Dr S Ramadoss strongly condemned the \"brutal\" police action against the 'peacefully protesting fisher-folks' who want the Russian-aided KNPP shut down.",

What came across in the inspection of records and initial probe being carried out by Tamil Nadu Police and Central Bureau of Investigation is irregularities in spending of funds received through donations. The Prime Minister in an interview to a foreign magazine had blamed some US-based NGOs for creating hurdles in launching the Kudankulam nuclear plant.<br /><br />Shinde said that the prime minister and the UPA government are clear that the nuclear energy is clean and cheap though the initial cost might be high.  <br /><br />The minister said the government is contemplating lowering of education qualification standards for selection in central police organisations. Many organisations have launched recruitment drives in these states but due to low educational qualification, very few could be recruited.<br /><br />\"We are now thinking to reduce the qualification standard for hiring these youth in police forces,\" he said. <br /><br />The minister, who is taking a stand different from the hardline adopted by his predecessor P Chidambaram, said the Jammu and Kashmir model will be replicated in 13 affected states where developmental schemes are already on. On a question that there are intelligence inputs of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba joining hands with the Maoists, he said that the government is fully alert to the activities of foreign organization which is unlikely to happen as the country's economy grows.<br /><br />Having rubbed the states wrong way while attempting to create NCTC, Sushilkumar Shinde also said he wants to create a separate force for intelligence gathering, despite the fact that Intelligence Bureau already exists.<br /><br />\"This is in total preliminary stage.

If it repeats twice, it is a farce. I can only say the trajectory of coincidences are uncanny\".<br /><br />\"That is something you have to infer yourself whether the is congruance is institutional or whether it is personal\", he said when asked whether Congress' attack was on the CAG as a person or on the institution.<br /><br />Chaturvedi's report on the Bofors issue way back in late eighties had led to the entire opposition resigning from the Lok Sabha. Chaturvedi had later joined BJP and became an MP and later a Governor.<br /><br />Referring to the CAG finding of Rs 1.86 lakh crore \"presumptive gain\" to private players in the coal block allocation issue, Tewari claimed \"there are very serious questions not only about computing methods but also on the basis on which they are structured\".<br /><br />The spokesperson said the CAG's \"notional figures\" had caused embarrassment for the country and that independent experts had questioned the reports.<br /><br />Reacting to a question that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said that he and the government respected the office of the CAG, the spokesperson said there was no divide on this between the PM and the party. <br /><br />Picking \"holes\" in the CAG's reports, Tewari said that in the last 22 months, the auditor has been \"tossing presumptive, hypotehtical and mythical figures in public domain which has made public discourse toxic and raised roadblocks in governance..It is unfortunate that these phenomenon has become a distressing recurring pattern\".<br /><br />Citing an instance, he said while the annual budget of HRD Ministry is Rs 16,000 crore, the CAG says the ministry has not accounted for Rs 1,16,000 crore. \"Will you call it mere an oversight?\"\", he added.<br /><br />Seeking to highlight the plight of the government in such a scenario, Tewari said observations by a body which carries the weight of the Constitution creates a very peculiar situation around the country.<br /><br />To a query whether the CAG has any personal enmity towards Congress, he said the question is not one of personal enmity or who appointed the CAG but the basis of the reports which have been questioned by experts in various fields.<br /><br />Asked to name the BJP leader who has talked to the CAG, the spokesman remarked \"let first BJP deny any such thing and then the name will come to the fore\".<br /><br />Tewari ducked questions on the CAG reports on BJP-ruled states like Chhattisgarh and Gujarat saying if they had any difficulties they should come out with facts as \"we had picked holes in various CAG reports\".<br /><br />\"The charges of double standards lies at the doorstep of BJP\", he said adding the opposition party plays different roles at the Centre and in the states ruled by it.<br /><br />Citing the criticism made by a former Secretary of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board E S Parthasarathy of the CAG, he said the official has demanded that the government auditor apologise to the President, Parliament and the people of India for making \"unpardonable misrepresentation\" of the Atomic Energy Act in one of its report.<br /><br />Replying to questions, he dismissed questions about any possibility of impeachment of the CAG",

The protestors have gone back to their villages and police have followed them to prevent the situation from going out of control,\" a police official in Tirunelveli district told IANS.<br /><br />According to him, police are yet to ascertain how many people were injured in the Monday morning clash.<br /><br />\"Several police officials have also been injured by stone-pelting protestors,\" he said.<br />Tamil television channel visuals showed village roads strewn with stones and burning tyres.<br /><br />\"The terrain is a very tough one,\" the police official said.<br /><br />Earlier, officials had announced that enriched uranium fuel would be loaded in the first of the two nuclear reactors around Sep 11.<br /><br />This is the first time police started cracking down on the protestors who launched their agitation against the atomic power plant more than a year ago.<br /><br />For the first time since the protests began, a large contingent of police have entered Idinthakarai village in Tirunelveli district, which has served as the hub of the protest. <br /><br />A resident of the village, speaking to IANS, said around 300 policemen were in the village.<br /><br />It was from this village that the anti-nuclear plant protestors charted their protest plans after the Tamil Nadu government gave its green signal to the project last year. The government had earlier asked the central government to allay the fears of the public before carrying out construction work.<br /><br />India's atomic power plant operator Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) is building two 1,000 MW reactors with Russian equipment at Kudankulam since 2001.<br /><br />Villagers under the People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy (PMANE) banner have opposed the project for the past one year, fearing for their safety, especially since the nuclear disaster at Fukushima in Japan March 2011.<br /><br />A Tamil television channel showed protestors throwing sand and stones at the police, who lobbed tear gas shells at the mob.<br /><br />The PMANE - that is spearheading the anti-KNPP movement - had decided to take its fight against the Rs.17,120-crore project near the plant away from Idinthakarai village near Kudankulam.<br /><br />On Sunday around 8,000 people including women and children from eight villages near Kudankulam assembled at the beach since morning to stage their protest.<br /><br />There is a prohibitory order against the assembly of people near the plant. Around 4,000 policemen have been deployed around the plant site.",

The next government will be of the NDA,\" he said.<br />Hussain also sought to take a dig at the Congress, saying that the party should first declare who was its prime ministerial candidate.<br /><br />\"First ruling party should tell us who is its prime ministerial candidate,\" he said.<br /><br />Thackeray had Sunday expressed admiration for Sushma Swaraj and termed her best to become the next prime minister.<br /><br />\"Presently, she is the most suited to the top post. I think she will make a dashing prime minister,\" he said in an interview published in the party mouthpiece \"Saamna\".<br /><br />\"There is a long queue for the post of prime minister. Only Sushma (Swaraj) is deserving, intelligent and could make an excellent choice for prime minister,\" Thackeray said, seeming to curb hopes of other leaders like Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar or Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi.<br /><br />Thackeray's comments indicated that his party may not favour Modi as NDA's prime ministerial candidate. Another NDA ally Janata Dal-United had earlier expressed its reservations over projecting Modi as the prime ministerial candidate of the alliance.<br /><br />Modi is among BJP leaders along with Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and party chief Nitin Gadkari who are seen in party circles as potential prime ministerial candidates. Party veteran Lal Krishna Advani has also not ruled himself out.<br /><br />BJP leaders have privately expressed surprise over the timing of Thackeray's pitch for Sushma Swaraj and said it was the first time an ally has openly backed a party leader for the prime minister's post.<br /><br />However, they said Thackeray's remarks were unlikely to queer the pitch as the party was determined to steer clear of the potentially explosive issue till the time of elections.<br /><br />The leaders said that all options were open for the party on announcing a prime ministerial candidate and the party may also decide against projecting a leader.<br /><br />They said the BJP leadership will factor in stance of the Congress and whether the party projects Rahul Gandhi as prime ministerial candidate for 2014 elections.",

Congress' earnings went up from Rs 222 crores in 2004 to Rs 307 crores in 2011 as is the case with BJP.<br /><br />The figures complied by ADR and NEW show that Congress' income is Rs 2,008 crores, mostly through selling of 'coupons', since it began heading a government at the Centre in 2004 till 2011 though the percentage of donations is just 14.42 per cent.<br /><br />On the contrary, 81.47 per cent of BJP's total income of Rs 994 crore in the past 7 years came through donations from corporate houses and trusts owned by major firms, including London-listed Vedanta, the NGO said.<br /><br />The NGOs said donations and voluntary contributions seem to be one of the major sources of income for most of the political parties and demanded more transparency in functioning of electoral trusts run by corporates and that political parties must be declared as public authorities.<br /><br />\"It is a black box of the political parties. Basic source of corruption in this country is political funding. By regulating political funding, we cannot end corruption, but can make a major dent,\" Prof Jagdee Chhokar, Founder member of ADR, told a press conference here.<br /><br />Interestingly, General Electoral Trust (GET) of the Aditya Birla Group and Torrent Power Limited have given donations to both Congress and BJP. While the GET gave Rs 36.4 crore as donations to Congress, it contribured Rs 26 crore to the BJP's coffers, according to the report.<br /><br />While national parties like Congress and BJP got donations from corporate houses and trusts, regional outfits like the DMK have received lakhs of ruppees as donation from its own partymen.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the CPI(M)'s income from 2004-2011 is Rs 417 crore, mostly contributions from individuals who have given less than Rs 20,000 each, just behind BSP's 484 crore, while other major Left party, CPI, has earned only Rs 6.7 crore. The SP's income, according to ADR, is Rs 278 crores.<br /><br />ADR and NEW said these figures were collected after a protracted battle with political parties and Income Tax Department through the Right to Information Act.<br /><br />Other major donators to Congress are Torrent Power Limited (Rs 14.15 crore), Bharti Electoral Trust of Airtel (Rs 11 crore), Tata's Electoral Trust (Rs 9 crore), Sterlite Industries (Rs 6 crore, ITC (Rs 5 crore), Adani Enterprises, Jindal Steel and Videocon Appliances.<br /><br />Again, GET has been the major contribuor to BJP's income by donating Rs 26 crore, followed by Torrent Power Limited (Rs 13 crore), and Public and Politial Awareness Centre, which the NGos claimed belong to Vedanta, (Rs 9.5 crore).<br /><br />Another interesting fact that emerged was Asianet TV holding gave Rs 10 crore to BJP and Rs 2.5 crore to Congress in the past seven years.<br /><br />The NGOs also said 18 regional or state parties have never filed their contribution reports to the Election Commission since 2004. Prominent among them include National Conference of J&amp;K, Trinamool Congress and INLD. <br /><br />The income of other parties are NCP (Rs 160 crore), AIADMK (Rs 59 crore), SAD (Rs 25 crore), National Conference (Rs 21 crore), JD(U) (Rs 26 crore), TDP (53 crore), DMK (Rs 40 crore), Trinamool (Rs 9 crore), Shiv Sena (Rs 32 crore), LJP (Rs 4 crore) TRS and RLD (Rs 10 crore each), Forward Bloc (Rs 98 lakh) and Sikkim Democratic Front (Rs 92 lakh), the least among all.<br /><br />While BSP has declared that it has not received any donations above Rs 20,000, the CPI said its leaders A B Bardhan and D Raja contributed Rs 65 lakh and Rs 21 lakh respectively by collecting donations from various sources.<br /><br />The NGOs also alleged that some of the companies whose names have been cropped up in the mining scam have also contributed to the political parties.<br /><br />It also alleged that FRCA rules have also been flouted by parties which received donations from foreign-listed companies.<br /><br />During 2009-2011, the TRS has 99.98 per cent of its income coming from donations followed by JD(U) and LJP.",

Out of the entire series, two lead compounds displayed the most pronounced activity,\" Ali told IANS.<br /><br />The research, conducted on mice and published in the journal \"Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy\", shows that the compounds used could trigger a genetically commanded self-destruction process called \"apoptosis\" or cell suicide.<br /><br />The lead compounds are safe, in that they did not show any negative effects on the liver or kidney and caused no mutation, Ali added.<br /><br />Leishmaniasis manifests mainly in three clinical forms: visceral leishmaniasis (VL), cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL).<br /><br />The leishmania parasite invades a particular type of white blood cell that ingests foreign bodies (called a macrophage) and establishes infection.",

Shah Commission alleged that there was a Rs.35,000 crore illegal mining scam in Goa. <br /><br />\"These assets should be auctioned for limited periods to maximize value to the state, after geological data is collected by the state,\" the online petition states.<br /><br />The petition was initiated by an online group Goa Speaks. It has demanded that all mines within five kilometres of wildlife sanctuaries be closed, as also those located close to the catchment area of the Selaulim dam, which provides water to nearly half of Goa's population of 14 lakh.<br /><br />\"Government will compute the costs of damage done to the environment of Goa and demand the necessary compensation from the Goa Mineral Ore Exporters Association (GMOEA) and its members,\" the petition states.<br /><br />The GMOEA is an association of ore exporters from Goa and accounts for a majority of the ore extracting units in the state.<br /><br />The petition has also sought a criminal enquiry into the theft of ore and an assurance from chief minister Manohar Parrikar, also the state mines minister, to \"walk the talk of Zero Corruption on mining illegalities\".<br /><br />One of Parrikar's main poll planks in the run up to the March assembly polls was \"zero tolerance to corruption\".<br /><br />Said Albertina Almeida, a lawyer and a rights activist based in Panaji, who was among the early signatories of the online petition: \"We cannot afford any further destruction of our peoples by mining illegalities. There needs to be a strong deterrent.\"<br /><br />Many Goans living abroad have signed the petition. Australia-based Goan Alvaro Peres da Costa said: \"I am a Goan, and I love Goa dearly. Those who have harmed it with all the illegalities and caused impoverishment of the common man must be given exemplary punishment - and at this stage, it behoves Mr Parrikar to mete it out as promised.\"<br /><br />Robert Williamson, a British national, said he signed the petition because \"so many of my friends in Goa are disgusted with the corruption generated by this illegal mining\".<br /><br />The Shah commission which tabled its report Friday in parliament has said Goa's politicians, bureaucrats and enforcement agencies colluded with mining industries, resulting in a mining scam that caused losses to the tune of Rs. 35,000 crore (approx) to the state. <br /><br />The Commission has virtually named all major mining companies in Goa, accusing them of large scale mining illegalities.",

The Supreme Court earlier, directed the authorities concerned to demarcate inter-state boundary.<br /><br />\"Earlier, there was a suggestion for fixing the border markers based on the latitude and longitude point available with the Department of Forests, but it was dropped, following complaints that the method was unscientific. Now, it is planned to demarcate the border areas on the basis of original survey map from the 'Deccan Survey Field Book'prepared by the Britishers in 1923,\" sources close to development told Deccan Herald. The exact dates for the survey have not been fixed yet, the process has already started, the sources added.<br /><br />Surveying border and its demarcation are challenging tasks for both states, due to destruction of \"GT station\" also known as triangulation station in three border villages - Obulapuram, H Siddapuram and Mallapanagudi. The triangulation station is also known as triangulation pillar, which is a fixed surveying station, used in geodetic surveying. The mining companies have reportedly removed the GT station and destroyed rock markers and other pillars on the border in order to shift their activities from Anantapur district to Bellary. <br /><br />It is alleged that six mining companies, including the Obalapuram Mining Company (OMC) owned by jailed mining baron Janardhana Reddy, mined in the border areas and removed the GT station and other border point markers illegally. The OMC which had mining permission in the Anantapur district had reportedly mined in the Bellary district by removing border markers. <br /><br />Samaja Parivarthana Samudaya, a Dharwad-based NGO, in its recent interlocutory application before SC pleaded for immediate demarcation of the boundary by setting up the GT station with permanent pillars and control points with latitude and longitude. The inter-state boundary has been under dispute for many years in Bellary district. Though, both states have conducted independent surveys in 1987 to find out the same, the two came out with two boundaries and inter-state border drawn by each, stretched into the areas of the other. <br /><br />Taking advantage, the mining firms engaged in mining activities in Anantapur district transgressed to the Bellary district and extracted over 21 lakh tonne, of ore illegally, it is alleged.<br />",

As a result, the current density which is at 92 per watt per square metre (W/Sqm)  will now have to be reduced to 0.92 W/Sqm. Similarly for the 900 Mhz GSM users the power density will be reduced from 48 W/Sqm to 0.48 W/Sqm.<br /><br />However, if the recommendations made to DoT in 2010 by a professor of IIT Mumbai are anything to go by, the reduction in radiation levels decided upon by the Inter Ministerial Committee, falls far short of what is required. <br /><br />In his report submitted to the DoT, Prof Girish Kumar of the Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Mumbai, recommended that radiation norms in India should conform those in some western nations, where they were less than 0.001 W/Sqm.<br /><br />The report observes, \"Many countries in the world have adopted much stricter maximum radiation density values of 0.001 to 0.24 W/ m2 (1/100th to 1/1000th of ICNIRP guidelines).\"<br /><br />The report had noted that India was following \"very relaxed\" radiation norms from mobile towers, \"whereas serious health effects have been noted at as low as 0.0001 W/m2\".<br /><br />On accord of this concern, the report recommended to the Centre to cut the cumulative power density to 0.1W/Sqm with \"immediate effect\", and progressively bring down the power density to 0.01 W/Sqm.   <br /><br />&quot;It must be noted that a few countries have even adopted 0.001 W/m&amp;sup2; or lower, so our proposed recommendation is higher than these countries to keep it cost effective,&quot; recommended the IITreport.<br /><br />However, the new norms are higher than that recommended by the study.<br /><br />As per the report of the Inter-Ministerial Committee, countries like Hungary (0.01W/Sqm), Switzerland (0.004W/Sqm), Italy (0.01 W/Sqm) and Australia (0.2W/Sqm) of power density. <br /><br />The radiation levels are alarmingly high for Tier-1 cities like Bangalore which houses 23,000 mobile towers and shared by 10 service providers in the City. According to DoT officials, the stringent regulations will now have to be implemented with inspections of these towers and ensure that they are below the recommended radiation levels.<br /><br />\"We have the capacity to inspect 10 percent of the 23,000 mobile towers in a year. The biggest threat is from mobile towers that have a larger number of antennas (corresponding to the number of service provider using the tower),\" said a DoT official.<br /><br />",

    "content": "India hopes to finish its flagship project in Afghanistan--construction of the new building for the Afghan Parliament--well before the US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) withdraws from combat operation in the war-wrecked country by 2014. About 60 per cent of work is yet to be completed. <br /><br />The foundation stone of the new building for the Afghan Parliament was laid during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Kabul on August 29, 2005, but it took almost four years to commence the construction. Though the project was to be completed by December 2011, India now hopes to finish constructing the landmark icon of democracy in Afghanistan by June 2013. The delay caused a 2.39 times' escalation in the cost of the project.  <br /><br />The ISAF is set to withdraw from combat operations in Afghanistan by 2014, leaving only a residual US counter-terrorism troops in the country, primarily to support the Afghan National Security Force.<br /><br />As resurgence of Taliban cast a cloud of uncertainty over the security situation that would unfold after the withdrawal of international forces, New Delhi is understood to be in touch with authorities in Kabul to speed up the construction work.<br /><br />The government assigned the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to construct the Parliament building in Kabul and the agency had in January 2006 estimated the cost at <br />Rs 296.45 crore. <br /><br />But, inordinate delay escalated the estimated expenditure to Rs 710 crore in December 2008, when the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) got the Union Cabinet's approval for the tendered cost of the project.<br /><br />The work on the site commenced in 2009. In a note to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the MEA reported that approximately 40 per cent of works had been completed by last June.<br /><br />Though deteriorating security situation slowed down other Indian projects in Afghanistan, construction of the new Parliament building in relatively secure capital city was rather delayed due to changes sought by the Afghan government in the layout and design of the edifice.<br /><br />The MEA cited the delay by the Afghan government in handing over the site to the CPWD and the changes it sought in the layout plan to match the centre-line of the new parliament building with the Darul Aman Palace, which was built during the reign of King Amanullah Khan in 1920s and was shelled and ruined by Afghan Mujahideen in 1988-89 after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.<br />",

Official sources said that the rising subsidy on fuel, food and fertiliser have put tremendous pressure on government's resources. <br /><br />At the same time, its revenues have not kept pace with the expenditures.

So much money is spent on these commissions but the only thing they do is talk to higher officials and do nothing.\"<br /><br />Banerjee's remark came a day after the state Human Rights Commission rapped the government over the harassment meted out to Jadavpur University Professor Ambikesh Mahapatra and awarded compensation to the latter who was accused of circulating a cartoon defaming Mamata.<br /><br />However, the state government, in less than 10 months after Mamata assumed power, set up 10 commissions of inquiry and the lone panel to complete its inquiry has run up a bill of Rs 72 lakh, only to come up with the findings identical to those of the police.<br /><br />The commission headed by Justice D P Sengupta was set up to find the reason behind the death of CPM legislator Mostafa Bin Quasem who jumped from the window of third floor of MLAs' hostel in Kolkata and died on May 29, 2011. The commission observed that the MLA had committed suicide,  a conclusion already arrived at by the police after recovering two suicide notes days after his death.  <br /><br />Of the other nine commissions, five are functioning but four are yet to start because there is apparently not enough office accommodation. A commission is given six months to conclude its work, but the trend, say law department officials, is at least one extension.<br /><br />CPI criticises<br /><br />When the state is going through dire financial straits, according to government sources, commission bills mount to Rs 33 lakh to Rs 36 lakh every six months.

The rocket then ejected a 15-kg Japanese micro-satellite \"Proiteres,\" to the delight of the space scientists at the SDSC.<br /><br />\"The PSLV-C21 has done its work and India deserves it,'' said the Isro official at the media centre here, as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who was accompanied by V Narayanasamy, MoS in the PMO, and a battery of space scientists and officials witnessed the launch from the New Mission Control Centre. Later, the prime minister congratulated Isro chairman K Radhakrishnan and his team on the feat and announced to the nation of Isro's 100th Space Mission being a \"spectacular success, a milestone in our nation's space capabilities\".<br /><br />Mission Director P Kunnikrishnan, addressing a news conference later with the Isro chief and other top scientists, said the PSLV-C21 had \"precisely injected'' the two satellites. The orbit \"was very precise and very consistent\" and all stages performed exceedingly well. The health of the two satellites \"is normal.'' To their great relief, the solar panels had also been deployed, marking the successful culmination of the mission from Isro's point of view.<br /><br />Radhakrishnan said Isro had committed to the two foreign satellite builders to launch their satellites into a &quot;655-km polar orbit inclined at an angle of 98.23 degree to the equator,&quot; with a dispersion of plus or minus 20 km from that committed figure. &quot;But, we have been able to achieve a dispersion within a 7-km range vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the orbit which proved the accuracy of our censors,&quot; the Isro chairman told reporters.<br /><br />Admitting that there was a two-minute delay in the PSLV-C21 lift-off on Sunday morning, Radhakrishnan said it was done after extensive consultations over the \"impact of possible debris in space that could come in the way'' when the satellites were launched from Sriharikota. \"We also had to look at possible collisions in space.''<br /><br />While Radhakrishnan declined to discuss how much Isro would be paid for the launch of these two foreign satellites due to the clause in the commercial agreement, he assured the media that cost of the mission had been recovered by this successful flight. <br /><br />\"We don't talk of net profit or loss'', he added. More importantly, this mission enabled testing of crucial technologies for Isro as well, including its \"new inertial navigation system and in bringing down the overall package mass by 50 kg,\" said Radhakrishnan.<br /><br />The PSLV-C21, significantly, has been the eighth flight of the PSLV in its \"core-alone configuration (without strap-on motors).\" But in carrying the 712-kg \"Spot-6\" payload of France on Sunday, the PSLV launched its heaviest satellite yet for an international customer, emphasised the Isro chief.",

Subsequently, he did his B E (Mechanical) from Madras University and went to the US on a government scholarship to pursue his master's in mechanical engineering from Michigan State University. In between, he completed special studies in engineering at Tata Iron and Steel Company Institute at Jamshedpur, Bihar, in February 1946 and underwent a nine-month specialised training in dairy engineering at the National Dairy Research Institute of Bangalore.<br /><br />He returned from America in 1948 and joined the dairy department of the Central government. In May 1949, he was posted as the dairy engineer at the Government Research Creamery, a small milk-powder factory, in Anand, Gujarat. Around this time, the newly formed co-operative dairy, Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers' Union Limited (KDCMPUL), was engaged in a battle of survival with the privately owned Polson Dairy, which was a giant in its field. Enthused by the challenge,  Kurien left his government job and volunteered to help Tribhuvandas Patel,  KDCMPUL chairman, to set up a processing plant. This effort of his led to the birth of Amul.<br /><br />From a few hundred litres a day to 90 lakh litres, the co-operative grew from strength to strength under him, building one of the most respected brands, Amul.<br /><br />Such is the prowess of the Amul revolution led by Kurien that the World Bank had identified the model as the key component to fight poverty. With his dedication and focussed approach, Kurien turned Amul into a Rs 10,000-crore turnover co-operative as against Rs 1,000 crore in early 90s.<br /><br />Women's role<br /><br />Kurien strongly believed that women could be the key partners in business development.

When we look at the enormous societal and national benefits that have been generated in diverse fields, there can be no doubt we are right,'' asserted Singh.<br /><br />Paying rich tributes to the pioneers of India's Space Programme, Singh also had loads of praises for the entire Isro fraternity, other scientists and the Department of Space, for Isro's 100th space mission being a \"spectacular success today\" (on Sunday). The prime minister also congratulated EADS Astrium of France and the Osaka Institute of Technology of Japan on the successful launch of their satellites on board the Indian-made launch vehicle, PSLV.<br /><br />\"This is a testimony to the commercial competitiveness of the Indian space industry and is a tribute to Indian innovation and ingenuity,'' he said. Sunday's accomplishment at Sriharikota also marked the 50th anniversary of the commencement of India's space programme.<br /><br />Recalling the contributions of the stalwarts to Indian space science development, Singh rued: \"We often forget how challenging space technology is and what a relatively new field it continues to be.  India is justly proud of her space scientists, who have overcome immense odds to set up world class facilities and develop advanced technologies,'' he said. \"We owe a great deal to pioneers like Vikram Sarabhai and Prof Satish Dhawan.''<br />Observing that it was appropriate that the new mission control Centre was also named after Prof Dhawan, the prime minister hoped that Isro would build on the glorious traditions and scale still greater heights. <br /><br />\"The Isro community has always been a source of inspiration to push the boundaries of science and technology for accelerated socio-economic development,\" he added.<br />",

The Centre is yet to finalise the financial outlay for the Department of Space in the 12th Five Year Plan.<br /><br />Radhakrishnan said though \"Mars orbiter mission\" poses several challenges, it is very much a part of the Plan. While the earliest opportunity for the Mars mission is October-November 2013, when the planet would be closest to the Earth, the next opportunities will be in 2016 and 2018, he said.<br /><br />\"Our objective is to get an elliptical orbit for the Mars Orbiter; we can build the spacecraft (an extended PSLV version) and also determine the orbit, but several other challenges like the quality of the module that needs to operate beyond 300 days can be met only in stages,\" the Isro chief said.<br /><br />Stating that India was not in competition with China on the 'Mars mission', he said India's space programme was based on a long-term vision for space technology applications. To a query, he said the Cabinet had approved only Rs150 crore for pre-project exercises to explore future growth potential areas in space exploration.  <br /><br />He said a \"multi-object tracking radar\" will be established at Sriharikota in the next three years to protect the Isro-launched satellites from the falling space debris.

In Delhi alone there are 1,000 people waiting for organ transplant,\" he said.<br /><br />According to a study by AIIMS, of the 1,40,000 lives lost in road accidents every year in India, 67 per cent deaths are due to head injuries. If organs can be retrieved from even ten per cent of these cadavers, the demand for organs in the country can be easily met, Jauhari said.",

Exactly at 9.53 a.m., Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle-C21 (PSLV-C21), 44 metres tall and weighing around 230 tonne, with a one-way ticket, hurtled itself towards the skies ferrying the two satellites - SPOT 6, a 712-kg French earth observation satellite, and Proiteres, a 15-kg Japanese micro satellite.<br /><br />The PSLV, costing around Rs.90 crore, blasted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, around 80 km from Chennai. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has now completed its 100th mission since the launch of its first satellite, Aryabhata, in 1975 by a Russian rocket.<br /><br />With a rich orange flame at its tail and plume of white smoke, PSLV-C21 ascended towards the sky amid cheers of ISRO scientists and media team assembled at the launch centre.<br /><br />People perched atop nearby buildings too clapped as the rocket went up. Scientists at ISRO's new mission control room were glued to their computer screens watching the rocket escape the earth's gravitational pull.<br /><br />At around 18 minutes into the flight, PSLV-C21 delivered SPOT 6 and a few seconds later Proiteres into their intended polar orbits. On the successful ejection of the satellites, scientists at mission control were visibly relieved and started clapping.<br /><br />Manmohan Singh, who along with Minister in Prime Minister's Office, V. Narayanasamy, witnessed the launch, congratulated ISRO scientists and engineers and EADS Astrium of France and Osaka Institute of Technology of Japan for the successful launch of their satellites.<br /><br />\"Questions are sometimes asked about whether a poor country like India can afford a space programme and whether the funds spent on space exploration, albeit modest, could be better utilised elsewhere.<br /><br />\"This misses the point that a nation's state of development is finally a product of its technological prowess,\" the prime minister said. The remote sensing satellites send back pictures and other data. <br /><br />SPOT 6 is the heaviest foreign satellite to be carried by a PSLV since 1999 when ISRO started launching satellites of foreign agencies. Proiteres will study powered flight of another satellite and observe Japan's Kansai district with a high-resolution camera.<br /><br />Speaking to reporters later, ISRO Chairman K. Radhakrishnan said discussions were on with the French space agency to carry SPOT 7, a similar remote sensing satellite slated for launch soon.<br /><br />He said there were 13 more satellites of similar class and some other satellites could go as co-passengers to the main cargo that ISRO/Antrix Corporation (ISRO's commercial arm) would target.<br /><br />Declining to reveal the carriage fee received from French and Japanese agencies for launching their satellites, Radhakrishnan said the mission revenue had recovered the rocket's cost.<br /><br />Agreeing that there was a two-minute delay in the rocket's lift off (the scheduled time was 9.51 a.m.), Radhakrishnan said it was to avoid possible space debris impacts. He said ISRO had decided to set up a Multi Object Tracking Radar (MOTR) to track space debris and time its rocket launches precisely.<br /><br />ISRO was also planning to have a second vehicle (rocket) assembly building to increase launch frequency, he said. ISRO would also build two more communication satellites - GSAT 15 and GSAT 16 - to augment its transponder (transmitters that receive and send signals) capacity, he added.<br /><br />Till date, ISRO has successfully launched 27 foreign satellites and the Sunday mission took the tally to 29.",

Such a formulation would be applicable only for domestic coal projects even though many imported coal-fired projects are becoming unviable due to escalation in overseas coal prices.<br /><br />In case of shortages in supplies from Coal India, the project developer can procure coal from alternate sources. However, this would be subject to \"technical limitations with the procurer having the first right of procurement with due liabilities and pre-specified timelines provided for both the parties\", among others.<br /><br />Issues related to severe fuel shortages, tariff revisions and various regulatory hurdles are expected to be addressed in the revised SBDs, which is in advanced stages of finalisation.<br /><br />The government has already held consultations with power producers on proposed changes in the bidding documents. Regarding blending option for domestic power projects, the Ministry has also suggested that the developer can sell the electricity in open market if the procurer refuses to avail the same.<br /><br />\"In case, the option of third party sale is not exercised by the developer, the risk is to be shared by developers and procurers in the ratio of 70:30 if and accordingly, payment of capacity charge will be made to the developer after deducting the penal recoveries from Coal India,\" the document said.<br /><br />Capacity charge implies fixed cost involved in generating power. The country is expected to have new capacity of over 80,000 MW in the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17), with majority coming from private sector.<br /><br />Meanwhile, at least 35,000 to 40,000 MW of existing power plants are stranded due to shortage in fuel supplies from Coal India.",

For Chandrayaan-2, Russia has to provide the lander. \"India will build the lunar orbiter and rover. Russia has said they would come to us with a decision after their review,\" K. Radhakrishnan told reporters. <br /><br />The Chandrayaan 2 is planned for 2014 with India's heavier rocket -- Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). Radhakrishnan said Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will ready the rocket and also the lunar orbiter and rover.<br /><br />While reports are there that the Chandrayaan 2 project may get delayed to 2016, Radhakrishnan did not comment on it. For its 100th mission, ISRO Sunday launched a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle-C21 carrying SPOT 6, a 712-kg French earth observation satellite, and Proiteres, a 15-kg Japanese micro satellite, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh.  <br /><br />ISRO is now eagerly looking forward to its Mars mission planned for next year. Ruling out that India was in race with China for the Mars mission, Radhakrishnan said: \"Mars mission is a challenging one where we will develop new technologies.\" He said ISRO was studying the Mars mission since August 2010 and the union cabinet had recently approved the project.<br /><br />He said the Mars mission was much more challenging than Chandrayaan 1 mission since it required taking the orbiter from the initial orbit into the Mars orbit as the distance to be covered was huge.<br /><br />Radhakrishnan said the other major challenge was tracking the satellite with deep space network. He said to realise the Mars mission next year, ISRO centres were working hard to perfect the GSLV rocket technology including the cryogenic engine technology.<br /><br />On the expansion of facilities at the space port here, Radhakrishnan said ISRO had decided to set up a Multi Object Tracking Radar to track the space debris and to time its rocket launches precisely.<br /><br />He said ISRO was also planning to have a second vehicle (rocket) assembly building to facilitate increasing launch frequency.

The monsoon session of Parliament was washed out due to repeated disruptions by the BJP over its demands for resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the wake of the coal scam.<br /><br />Asked about the recent wasted session, Mukherjee said, leaders of different political parties should work out a mechanism to resolve differences and ensure that institutions of Parliament can work.<br /><br />He recalled that on an earlier occasion also in 2009, the whole session was disrupted (on demands for a JPC) and the entire winter session business could not be transacted.<br /><br />Mukherjee noted that every session of Parliament was important and even the last session was important.

He was instrumental in laying the foundation of democratic enterprises at the remote villages and farflung hamlets which ensured economic justice. And it was with people's voluntary participation.<br /><br />Honoured as the architect of India's White Revolution, which catapulted India to be the world's largest milk producer, Kurien managed the feat in the 1970s at a time when it faced grim uncertainties over its food security.<br /><br />Kurien, the founder-chairman of National Dairy Development Board (1965-98) and also chairman of Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (GCMMF)(1973-2006), and also the Institute of Rural management (1979-2006), dedicated his life to the cause of empowering the humble Indian farmers through co-operatives, said current GCMMF Managing Director R.S. Sodhi.<br /><br />\"He strongly believed that by placing technology and professional management in the hands of the farmers, the living standards of millions of rural poor could be improved,\" Sodhi said Sunday in a tribute to Kurien's management skills.<br /><br />Born Nov 26, 1921 in Kozhikode, Kerala, Kurien - who was destined to become India's top 'milkman' - graduated from Loyola College in 1940 and later completed his engineering from Guindy College of Engineering, Chennai. But it was after a brief stint at TISCO that he obtained a government of India scholarship to study dairy engineering.<br /><br />Having acquired specialized training at the Imperial Institute of Animal Husbandry and Dairying in Bangalore, Kurien went to the US and completed his masters in Mechanical Engineering with dairy engineering as a minor subject from the Michigan State University, in 1948. A year later, he was assigned to a Government Creamery in Anand, Gujarat as part of his bond commitment.<br /><br />Arriving in Anand on a hot May 13 in 1949, Kurien was a harried man, only waiting to be released from his bond and leave the place as quickly as possible. He got his release orders after six months and was all set to pack up and go to the city of big bucks, Bombay (now, Mumbai) - but a minor incident halted him in his tracks.<br /><br />Just as he was preparing his exit, Tribhuvandas Patel, the then chairman of Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers Union, popularly known as 'Amul', with whom Kurien had developed a good friendship, requested him to stay back in Anand for some more time and help him organise his co-operative society's dairy equipment.<br /><br />Kurien stayed back for a few more days...going on to become a legend through Operation Flood, launched in 1971. \"His forced tenure at Anand changed the destiny of the entire Indian dairy sector. He help the fledgling dairy co-operative movement and was forced to stay there to see it flourish. The rest is history,\" Sodhi said.<br /><br />The Dairy co-operative movement had a modest beginning with the first Dairy Co-operative Union in Gujarat formed in 1942 with only two village co-operatives joining as members.<br /><br />Around 65 years later that figure has grown to a staggering 16,100 with 3.20 million milk producers pouring millions of tonnes of milk into the GCMMF containers twice daily.<br /><br />The NDDB, formed by Kurien's efforts, replicated the Amul Model all over India with remarkable results which dramatically increased the country's milk production. Through Kurien's efforts vide the Amul Model, the country's milk production shot up from a mere 20 million metric tonnes (MMT) per annum in 1960 to a whopping 122 MMT last year.<br /><br />The GCMMF's average daily milk production rose from 2.50 million kgs to 12.5 million kgs during the same period. Kurien's main contribution was to design systems and institutions, which people could develop themselves, as he believed development of man can best be achieved by putting in his hands the instruments of development.<br /><br />\"He believed that the greatest assets of this country are its people, and dedicated his life to the task of harnessing the power of the people in a manner which promoted <br />their larger interests,\" Sodhi explained.<br /><br />He proved it by the Operation Flood in 1971 - creating a national milk grid - which was implemented in three phases. Not only did it result in making India the world's largest producer of milk and milk products, it also helped reduce malpractices by milk producers and merchants, and alleviated poverty during that era.<br /><br />The world took note of Kurien's efforts and showered honours on him, including India's Padma Vibhushan, the World Food Prize, Magsaysay Award, Carnegie-Wateler World Peace Prize, International Person of Year from US and other recognitions, for his work that touched millions of lives everyday in remote areas.<br />",

The passage of the Constitution amendment bill has been delayed at least till the Winter session. But following opposition by Samajwadi Party and Shiv Sena and disruptions caused by NDA over coalgate issue, it could not be taken up for consideration and passage.<br /><br />SCs and STs have been provided reservation in promotions since 1955. This was discontinued following the judgement in the case of Indra Sawhney wherein it was held that it is beyond the mandate of Article 16(4) of the Constitution.<br /><br />Subsequently, the Constitution was amended by the Constitution (77th Amendment) Act, 1995 and a new clause (4A) was inserted in Article 16 to enable the government to provide reservation in promotion.<br /><br />Later, clause (4A) was modified by the Constitution (85th Amendment) Act, 2001 to provide consequential seniority to  SC and ST candidates promoted by giving reservation.<br /><br />The validity of the Constitutional amendments was challenged before the Supreme Court. The apex court, while deliberating on the issue of validity of Constitutional amendments in the case of M Nagaraj, observed that the concerned state will have to show in each case the existence of the compelling reasons: backwardness, inadequacy of representation and overall administrative efficiency before making provision for reservation in promotion.<br /><br />Based on the judgement of the Supreme Court, the high courts of Rajasthan and Allahabad struck down the provisions for reservation in promotion in the services of the two states.<br /><br />Subsequently, the Supreme Court has upheld the decisions of these high courts striking down provisions for reservation in respective states. The latest Constitutional amendment on the issue is aimed at circumventing the Supreme Court order.",

Exactly at 9.53 a.m., Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle-C21 (PSLV-C21), 44 metres tall and weighing around 230 tonne, with a one-way ticket, hurtled itself towards the skies ferrying the two satellites - SPOT 6, a 712-kg French earth observation satellite, and Proiteres, a 15-kg Japanese micro satellite.<br /><br />The PSLV, costing around Rs.90 crore, blasted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, around 80 km from Chennai. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has now completed its 100th mission since the launch of its first satellite, Aryabhata, in 1975 by a Russian rocket.<br /><br />With a rich orange flame at its tail and plume of white smoke, PSLV-C21 ascended towards the sky amid cheers of ISRO scientists and media team assembled at the launch centre.<br /><br />People perched atop nearby buildings too clapped as the rocket went up. Scientists at ISRO's new mission control room were glued to their computer screens watching the rocket escape the earth's gravitational pull.<br /><br />At around 18 minutes into the flight, PSLV-C21 delivered SPOT 6 and a few seconds later Proiteres into their intended polar orbits. On the successful ejection of the satellites, scientists at mission control were visibly relieved and started clapping.<br /><br />Manmohan Singh, who along with Minister in Prime Minister's Office, V. Narayanasamy, witnessed the launch, congratulated ISRO scientists and engineers and EADS Astrium of France and Osaka Institute of Technology of Japan for the successful launch of their satellites.<br /><br />\"Questions are sometimes asked about whether a poor country like India can afford a space programme and whether the funds spent on space exploration, albeit modest, could be better utilised elsewhere.<br /><br />\"This misses the point that a nation's state of development is finally a product of its technological prowess,\" the prime minister said. The remote sensing satellites send back pictures and other data. <br /><br />SPOT 6 is the heaviest foreign satellite to be carried by a PSLV since 1999 when ISRO started launching satellites of foreign agencies. Proiteres will study powered flight of another satellite and observe Japan's Kansai district with a high-resolution camera.<br /><br />Speaking to reporters later, ISRO Chairman K. Radhakrishnan said discussions were on with the French space agency to carry SPOT 7, a similar remote sensing satellite slated for launch soon.<br /><br />He said there were 13 more satellites of similar class and some other satellites could go as co-passengers to the main cargo that ISRO/Antrix Corporation (ISRO's commercial arm) would target.<br /><br />Declining to reveal the carriage fee received from French and Japanese agencies for launching their satellites, Radhakrishnan said the mission revenue had recovered the rocket's cost.<br /><br />Agreeing that there was a two-minute delay in the rocket's lift off (the scheduled time was 9.51 a.m.), Radhakrishnan said it was to avoid possible space debris impacts. He said ISRO had decided to set up a Multi Object Tracking Radar (MOTR) to track space debris and time its rocket launches precisely.<br /><br />ISRO was also planning to have a second vehicle (rocket) assembly building to increase launch frequency, he said. ISRO would also build two more communication satellites - GSAT 15 and GSAT 16 - to augment its transponder (transmitters that receive and send signals) capacity, he added.<br /><br />Till date, ISRO has successfully launched 27 foreign satellites and the Sunday mission took the tally to 29.<br />",

    "content": "An Indian rocket carrying two satellites  blasted off from the first launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre here in Andhra Pradesh Sunday, with the launch being witnessed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.<br /><br />The rocket carried two foreign satellites - SPOT 6, a French satellite and a Japanese micro satellite called Proiteres. Manmohan Singh along with Minister in Prime Minister Office, V. Narayanasamy, were present to witness the launch at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) here. Sriharikota is around 80 km north of Chennai. <br /><br />Exactly at 9.51 a.m., the rocket - Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle-C21 (PSLV-C21), standing around 44 metres tall and weighing around 230 tonne, with a one way ticket - hurtled towards the skies ferrying the two foreign satellites - SPOT 6, a French earth observation satellite weighing 712 kg and 15 kg micro satellite Proiteres of Japan.<br /><br />The cost of the rocket is around Rs.75 crores. Proiteres is intended to study powered flight of a small satellite by an electric thruster and observe Japan's Kansai district with a high resolution camera.<br /><br />Manmohan Singh watched the historic 100th mission of the Indian space agency and scientists at Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) rocket's mission control room kept an eye on the rocket that escaped the earth's gravitational pull.<br /><br />ISRO officials are hoping that the agency's 100th space mission will turn out to be a grand success. The PSLV-C21 rocket is expected to deliver SPOT 6 and Proiteres into a 655 km polar orbit.<br /><br />Remote sensing satellites send back pictures and other data. The SPOT and Indian remote sensing satellites are the two leading earth observation satellite series. Interestingly SPOT 6 is the heaviest foreign satellite to be carried by a PSLV rocket since 1999 when ISRO started launching satellites owned by foreign agencies. ISRO has been carrying foreign satellites since 1999 initially as an add-on luggage to its own satellite.<br /><br />It was with Agile, a 350 kg Italian satellite, that ISRO started flying a full commercial rocket. Till date ISRO has launched 27 foreign satellites successfully and the Sunday mission would take the tally to 29.<br /><br />The successful launch of SPOT 6 would make ISRO's PSLV rocket a strong contender to carry SPOT 7 planned by French company Astrium SAS soon. According to ISRO, the satellite launch agreement between Antrix and Astrium is part of the long-term agreement signed between the two agencies in September 2008.<br /><br />The space agency has also jointly built two heavy satellites - 3,453 kg W2M and 2,541 kg Hylas - for the French agency. India has the largest constellation of remote sensing satellites in the world providing imagery in a variety of spatial resolutions, from more than a metre ranging up to 500 metres, and is a major player in vending such data in the global market.<br /><br />With 12 remote sensing/earth observation satellites orbiting in the space, India is a world leader in the remote sensing data market. The 12 satellites are TES, Resourcesat 1, Cartosat 1, 2, 2A and 2B, IMS 1, Risat-2, Oceansat 2, Resourcesat-2, Megha-Tropiques and Risat-1.",

He had held the coal portfolio during the UPA-I government, when most of these blocks were allocated.<br />During the three-day IMG meeting, all the 29 allottees gave progress reports of their blocks and several of them said delays in starting the production resulted due to lack of various clearances from different state governments.<br /><br />Coal block allottees, including Tata Steel, Reliance Power, JSW, Grasim Industries, Kesoram Industries, IST Steel &amp; Power, SKS Ispat and Power, Bihar Sponge Iron, appeared before the panel during IMG's three-day review exercise.<br /><br />Before the start of the review exercise, the Coal Ministry had said on September 3 that the latest progress as reported by the Coal Controller will also be taken into account by the IMG \"before recommending on the action against the coal block allottees.\" <br />The IMG has also firmed up the guidelines for proportionate deduction of bank guarantees for failure to achieve milestones for development of the block, it said.  After its presentation today, IST Steel &amp; Power, in which former Corporate Affairs Minister Prem Chand Gupta's son Gaurav Gupta is a Director, said it did not know why a show- cause notice was sent to it as its coal block in Chhattisgarh is progressing on schedule.<br />SKS Ispat and Power, in which Tourism Minister Subodh Kant Sahai's brother held the position of \"honorary director\", also presented its case before the IMG.<br /><br />Bhushan Steel &amp; Power, which had been allotted Bijahan coal mine in Odisha, said it has already conveyed to the Ministry that the end-use plant for which it was alloted mine in 2006 is already under operation.<br /><br />&quot;The end use plant is already is completed and we have invested Rs 22,000 crore in the integrated steel and power plant and we have covered all the major milestone like land acquisition, mining plan approved,&quot; an official of Bhushan Steel &amp; Power said.<br /><br />Another official with Himachal Emta Power Ltd which was alloted Gourangdih ABC coal block along with JSW Steel said due to some technical problem in the block, the company had to revise the mining plan of the block.<br /><br />An official of the Mukund Steel which was alloted Rajhara North (Central &amp; Eastern) block said there was no delay from the company's side.",

Rajveer was declared brought dead at Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital, while Manish is undergoing treatment for critical injuries at Lok Nayak Hospital.<br /><br />\"Manish's medical condition remains critical. Questioning him is crucial to confirm the reason behind them taking such an extreme step and to ascertain the exact sequence of events. However, we would not be able to question him until doctors at the hospital give the permission,\" a senior police official said.<br /><br />Sources claimed that Rajveer was depressed for a long time, which may have instigated him to attack his family members. Police said they will question Rajveer's family once they are done with the last rites.<br /><br />During the shooting spree, they attacked Rajveer's wife Pooja, 25, and daughters Khushi, 8, and Rashi, 3, Rajveer's elder brother Kishan Sharma, 38,  Rajveer's former girlfriend Usha Yadav, 25, and Manish's former girlfriend Jyoti Saini, 23.<br /><br />Khushi, Jyoti and Usha were killed in the incident, while Pooja, Rashi and Kishan suffered injuries. All the victims were initially taken to Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital, and the critically injured were later shifted to Lok Nayak Hospital.<br /><br />Initial investigation has revealed that 15 to 20 rounds were fired by Rajveer and Manish. Three country-made pistols and seven live cartridges were also recovered from Rajveer's house on Friday. \"A probe is on to find out from where they managed to collect the arms and ammunition,\" the official added.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Usha's father Roshan Lal Yadav, who runs a small shop in the Swaroop Nagar, said his daughter was a hardworking teacher with a private school in Model Town. Sources claim that Usha was Rajveer's former girlfriend, but Roshan Lal denies it. \"She wasn't romantically involved with anyone - be it Rajveer or anyone else. All that mattered to my daughter was tending to her mother with two dysfunctional kidneys and her younger brother who is working hard to become an IAS officer,\" he said. <br /><br />Usha used to juggle a teaching job with tuition after completing a bachelor's degree in education from Delhi University last year.<br />",

A top BSF officer said about 80 spots had been identified and mapped, taking into consideration the geographical patterns including thick foliage. He said Pakistan might exploit the weak areas to build more in future for pushing men and contraband material.<br /><br />The BSF plans to post armed personnel to man the areas as available equipment&amp;mdash;seismic sensors&amp;mdash;cannot cover such a long border. Seismic sensors have limitations since they can only provide vertical information of a hole beneath the ground level but they cannot give sweeping details on horizontally running tunnels.  <br /><br />The BSF is digging through the tunnel to find out the other end near to the fence fpr strategising counter measures. The sources said Pakistanis had taken out ventilator pipes from the tunnel as the BSF personnel started reverse digging of the tunnel.<br /><br />The officers also ruled out the Pakistanis employing a similar strategy on other stretches of the border in Kashmir, Rajasthan and Gujarat, since these places are either rocky or the soil is not hard enough to shore up tunnel below the ground level. <br /><br />US technology<br /><br />The BSF plans to purchase underground sensors that are used by the US and the Israeli troops to check infiltration on their borders.

Former home minister P Chidambaram had announced that the issue would be taken up at the highest level with the Pakistan government.<br /><br />\"That the tunnel digging was a professional job was established by the fact that it not only ran through the Indo-Pak border but had two-inch air supply pipe to ensure people get oxygen for breathing while crawling in it,\" the sources said.  <br /><br />The force had also sought the help of the Army, Indian Space Research Organisation and Geological Society of India to ascertain the length of the tunnel.<br /><br />Share info to avoid attacks: Pak Minister<br /><br />India must share intelligence on terrorists with Pakistan so that a \"Mumbai-type terror attack does not take place again,\" Interior Minister Rehman Malik said in Islamabadon Saturday, report agencies.<br /><br />After inking an agreement with India on a liberalised visa agreement, Rehman Malik said,  \"One good thing is that both countries are ready to talk on everything including  Kashmir.\" The agreement was signed by Malik and Indian External Affairs Minister S M Krishna who arrived in Pakistan on Friday on a three-day visit.<br /><br />Malik announced that all Indian fishermen in Pakistani prisons \"stand released today as a goodwill gesture for his (Krishna's) visit\".

Six were children.<br /><br />Eleven of the 13 accused are from Tamil Nadu and one each from Kerala and Sri Lanka. They were attempting to transport the 84 refugees to Australia by sea from Tannirbavi in Mangalore. <br /><br />The accused had promised jobs in Australia and had collected money ranging from Rs 30,000 to Rs 1 lakh from each of the refugees. <br /><br />The victims were from 27 refugee camps in Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, Madurai, Pudukottai, Palar Anikattu, Tiruvanvelvi and Hosur.

About 6,000 litres of diesel and food were found in the seized boat in which the refugees were to be transported. <br /><br />Ten mobile phones, Rs 2,84,000 in cash and some identity cards issued by the refugee camps were seized by the police. <br /><br />Pratap Reddy said the accused were involved in human trafficking earlier, too.

The traffickers had been cheating the refugees, exploiting their lack of valid documents, including passports.<br /><br />Reddy said a team of Tamil Nadu police had arrived in the city. Another team would arrive on Sunday.<br /><br />He said the refugees would be sent back to the camps once their identities were ascertained. <br /><br />\"This is the first major human trafficking case unearthed in Mangalore or perhaps in the State in the recent past.

We must train our police personnel to develop these soft skills,\" Singh said.<br /><br />He advised senior police officers to have advance identification of potential trouble makers, timely use of preventive sections of the law, besides seeking cooperation of the community for maintaining peace should be the used first well before a situation deteriorates. <br /><br />He also agreed with earlier assertions of Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde and Intelligence Bureau director that the use of social media for creating unrest in the country was a new trend confronting the policing in the country.<br /><br />\"We need to fully understand how these new media are used by miscreants. We also need to devise strategies to counter the propaganda that is carried out by these new means. Any measure to control the use of such media must be carefully weighed against the need for the freedom to express and communicate,\" he pointed out.<br /><br />He also called for strengthening government-academia-private sector partnership to have a secured cyber security. \"Our country's vulnerability to cyber crime is escalating as our economy and critical infrastructure become increasingly reliant on interdependent computer networks and the internet.

So, we need to catch the real guys behind such prostitution rackets instead of booking the prostitute who may be a victim,\" he said.<br /><br />Singh said 90 per cent of human trafficking in India takes place internally even as the country itself remains one of the main origins of trafficking in the world. The CBI Director said there was an urgent need to regulate regulate activities of placement agencies.<br /><br />\"With urbanisation, demand for domestic helps has increased and many placement agencies have mushroomed in cities and towns which bring children, many less than even 14 years, from poor regions and sell them to needy households,\" the Director said.<br /><br />He said CBI has come across many cases where such helps are physically and mentally abused. Later, in a presentation before the police chiefs of the states on behalf of the CBI Director, DIG Anurag Garg, who heads the anti-trafficking cell of the agency, said globally about 21 million people are trafficked for forced labour or prostitution at any given time.<br /><br />He said the data means three out of every 1,000 persons is being exploited, which is quite disconcerting. \"CBI has investigated quite a few cases of human trafficking. <br />There is absolutely no doubt that it is an organised crime which brings culprits from different parts of the country together to make money out of sufferings of victims,\" he said.<br /><br />Garg said traffickers operate under fake names and keep changing their locations to escape detection. \"Even victims are given different identities every time they are caught and these victims are sold from one person to another like a commodity to be exploited. In fact, this makes investigation quite challenging,\" he said.<br /><br />The officer said although the role of NGOs becomes important in tackling the problem, the agencies must be cautious in building such relationships as sometimes these organisations also indulge in \"dubious\" activities.",

    "content": "Sounding a note of caution on judicial activism, President Pranab Mukherjee today said judicial pronouncements must respect the boundaries that separate the legislature, executive and judiciary.<br /><br />Making his first visit outside the national capital after assuming the office of President on July 25, Mukherjee also said that everything must be done to protect the independence of judiciary from any form of encroachment.<br /><br />Addressing the valedictory function of the 150th anniversary celebrations of the Madras High Court, he urged judiciary to keep reinventing itself through a process of introspection and self-correction at the same time.<br /><br />In his address, Mukherjee touched upon various issues that dominate legal discourse including judicial accountability and the appointment of judges. The President referred to judicial activism and said the judges through innovation and activism have contributed enormously to expanding the frontiers of justice and providing access to the poorest of the poor.<br /><br />\"However, a note of caution needs to be sounded. Judicial activism should not lead to the Constitutional principles of separation of power getting eroded. Judicial pronouncements must respect the boundaries that separate the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary,\" he said.<br /><br />Referring to backlog of cases, the President said the courts must be strengthened with additional resources to provide speedy justice and that government was fully engaged in this task.<br /><br />The filling of vacancies in courts across the country is a matter that must be taken up as a priority by all concerned. \"We must make haste in this regard but without compromising on quality,\" he said.<br /><br />Judges of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice M Y Eqbal and other judges of the Madras High Court, Governor K Rosaiah, Chief Minister J Jayalaithaa and lawyers were among others present on the occasion.<br /><br />Madras High Court was one of the three Courts established in India by Letters Patent issued by Queen Victoria after the Calcutta and Bombay High Courts in 1862. <br /><br />Mukherjee said a national mission for justice delivery has been launched and the Constitution was being amended to raise the retirement age of High Court Judges. Efforts are also being made to create an All India Judicial Service.<br /><br />He said the separation of powers, one of the basic features of the Constitution, ensures that each organ of the government operates within its sphere and none takes over the functions of the other.<br /><br />\"It is the Constitution that is supreme. The laws are enacted by the legislature, the executive does the implementation and the judiciary is the final interpreter of these laws. The delicate balance of power enshrined in the Constitution should be maintained at all times,\" he said.<br /><br />The President said the principle of separation of powers is equally a priciple of restraint. While the exercise of powers of the legislature and executive are subject to judicial review, the only check on judiciary's exercise of powers is the self-imposed discipline and self restraint.<br /><br />Against the backdrop of the current debate over the proposed Judicial Accountability Bill, he said judging the judges was a delicate and sensitive topic and one which has been viewed with some concern by jurists.<br /><br />\"Legislation which carefully balances the independence of the judiciary with the need to protect and preserve its credibility is a useful complement to the judiciary's own efforts.<br /><br />\"Ultimately, the credibility of the judiciary will depend on the quality of the judges who man the various Courts of the country. Therefore, the process of selection and appointment of judges should conform to the highest of standards and should be based on well established principles,\" Mukherjee said.<br /><br />The President said independence of judiciary is widely recognised and a matter of pride for every citizen of the country. The Indian judiciary, he said, has enlarged the scope of fundamental rights, increased the space for democracy while maintaining the quality of justice delivered.<br /><br />\"We must do everything possible to preserve and protect the independence of our judiciary from any form of encroachment. \"At the same time, the judiciary, as an important pillar of democracy, must also keep reinventing itself through a process of introspection and self-correction,\" Mukherjee said.<br /><br />Noting that justice delayed is justice denied, he said administration of justice must be accessible to all. The President said the judicial system should not only be accessible but also affordable.<br /><br />\"The fact that litigation is time consuming and expensive is well known. To address this, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration should be encouraged.<br /><br />\"This will help ensure timely and effective justice and ease judicial pendency. The judiciary has a crucial role to play in the administration of the Legal Services Authority Act which has multiple objectives. Greater efforts are also needed to speed legal literacy across the nation,\" he said.",

BJP has been demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the Coalgate row.<br /><br />\"BJP men, who are levelling allegations, should be asked to get resignation of their CMs that why they executed the lease,\" he told a news conference. \"Because the responsibility was theirs(since) they executed the lease and decided that in whose favour it would be done,\" he claimed.<br /><br />The Congress leader put the onus on the states in the Coalgate row while referring to questions being raised on what basis allocation of coal blocks was done and that allegations are being levelled against Centre's officers.<br /><br />Sibal said that under Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development Act) only the state governments have the right to execute lease. \"Centre has no right in it. If any person has objection to the lease executed in favour of a particular person or company, whose responsibility was it,\" he added.Sibal alleged that BJP was trying to create confusion of heavy financial losses having occurred in coal block allotment on the basis of the CAG report.<br /><br />\"The disputed coal blocks were allotted for use in power, steel and cement producing plants and not for sale. When anything has not been sold then how can you calculate loss and profit,\" he said.<br /><br />Without taking names, Sibal alleged a Rajya Sabha leader had said there was no point in a debate on the issue in Parliament as the government has a majority and similar was the situation in the Public Accounts Committee and therefore the House should not be allowed to run.<br /><br />\"I believe that not allowing to function is a facist step,\" he alleged. In reply to a question, the minister said cancellation of coal block allotment would have an adverse impact on the power generation in the country.<br /><br />He said it takes seven to eight years in making a coal block functional and if allotments were cancelled then it would take similar number of years to mine coal and in such a situation what would be the impact on coal-based economy.<br /><br />Sibal alleged that BJP was demanding cancellation without knowing the nitty gritty of the economic system.<br /><br />He said these were the important issues which could also be addressed when the Parliament was allowed to function.<br /><br />In a reply to another question, the minister said he does not want to say that CAG was incompetent, but it was true that his mathematics of proft-loss was wrong.<br /><br />On the reservation for SC/ST job promotion quota bill, Sibal said confusion was sought to be created and that the state governments would have the right to take a decision on giving any type of reservation.

After parking, a small religious ceremony was conducted to welcome the aircraft in the presence of Air India CMD Rohit Nandan and senior Civil Aviation Ministry and airline officials.<br /><br />The Dreamliner took 15 hours of flying time from Boeing's Charleston factory in South Carolina in the US to Delhi, plus a 90-minute stopover at Frankfurt for re-fuelling, the commander of the aircraft, Capt A S Soman, told PTI.<br /><br />\"It was a very smooth flight. It has a very quite cabin and there is much less fatigue (for the pilot). It is both a pilot and passenger friendly airplane,\" he said. Air India, which ordered 27 Dreamliners six years ago, would get two more of these planes in the next few weeks. A total of eight of them would arrive by March next year, including five by December, while the national carrier would get six more in the 2012-13 fiscal.<br /><br />The aircraft would ultimately become the mainstay of Air India's global operations and is key to its turnaround plan. For Air India, the plane has been configured to have 256 seats -- 18 full-flat Business Class seats and 238 in Economy. It features a host of sophisticated technologies, including mood-lighting inside the cabin and large LCD display screens for in-flight entertainment. <br /><br />For the next two months, Air India would use the B-787s to operate on select sectors like Delhi-Dubai, Delhi-Kolkata, Delhi-Bangalore and Delhi-Amritsar for the crew to practice more landings and take-offs. So far, a total 65 pilots have been trained to fly this plane.<br /><br />The mid-size plane has four variants, with the longest -range one capable of flying over 15,000 kms non-stop. By December, Air India would introduce these aircraft on new long-haul sectors like Melbourne and Sydney, apart from the older ones like Japan, Middleast and several European destinations.<br /><br />A top official of its manufacturer Boeing recently described the aircraft as \"the fundamentally right aircraft for Air India's turnaround plan\". The plane, made of carbon composite material, is light- weight and is considered less of a fuel guzzler. Boeing claims the plane consumes 20 per cent less fuel compared with the similar-sized B-767s, thereby lowering flying costs.<br /><br />The first batch was supposed to be delivered in September 2008 but design and production issues at Boeing delayed deliveries. According to Boeing, the aircraft was ready for delivery in May but it got delayed over finalisation of compensation agreement between Air India and the aircraft manufacturer. The agreement deals with the compensation to be given by the US aircraft major for almost four-year delay in deliveries.<br /><br />Air India was the world's second carrier to have placed orders for this aircraft. Delays in clearing of the agreement and in the plane's deliveries to Air India, made it the fifth airline to get it.<br /><br />Theairlines which have inducted and are already operating this aircraft are Japan's All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, Ethiopian Airways and Lan Airlines of Chile.",

Based on the results it will be decided whether the unit will be given a one year or five year operational licence,\" S.S.Bajaj, chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) told IANS on phone from Mumbai.<br /><br />India's atomic power plant operator Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) is setting up the KNPP at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu's Tirunelveli district, around 650 km from here with two Russian made VVER 1000 reactors. The first unit is in advanced stage of commissioning with AERB giving its nod Aug 10 to load the 163 of enriched uranium fuel bundles in the reactor.<br /><br />\"After fuel loading NPCIL will have to do certain tests. Based on the test results we will give clearance for criticality. Following that raising of power generation will be permitted in stages and the reactor has to operate at 100 percent satisfactorily for sometime,\" Bajaj said.<br /><br />The AERB would then issue NPCIL the operational licence for the first unit of KNPP. The atomic energy regulator does not give operational licence for the full life of the reactor.<br /><br />Every five years a nuclear power plant operator - currently only NPCIL - has to provide a set of data relating to a unit to the regulator and get its operational licence renewed.<br /><br />After the nuclear accident at Fukushima in Japan, additional safety measures-short and long term- for Indian nuclear plants have to be implemented and NPCIL have to give a road map to the regulator as to the implementation of the fresh safety measures. As a result, two of NPCIL's power stations - Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS) and the first two units at Tarapur Atomic Power Station (TAPS) - are being issued limited period licence to operate since Dec 31, 2010, and March 31, 2011, when their licence came up for renewal.<br /><br />Citing the fact that NPCIL has not fully implemented some of the post Fukushima safety measures at KNPP and its possibility of getting a five year operational licence Bajaj said: \"The post Fukushima safety measures are more relevant for older nuclear power plants. The KNPP has adequate safety measures to overcome situations like that happened in Fukushima (tsunami and earthquake resulting in total power failure).\"<br /><br />\"Normally if the reactor is first of its kind then five year operational licence is not issued. Only one year licence is issued,\" S.A. Bhardwaj, director (Technical) at NPCIL told IANS over phone from Mumbai. He said only on the satisfactory performance of the new reactor a five year operational licence is issued to that unit.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the loading of fuel bundles in the first unit of the two 1,000 MW Russian reactors at KNPP will happen between Sep 11-15. Bhardwaj said the fuel loading process would take around one week and the observers from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) may come at the start or at the end as KNPP reactors fall under the safeguard agreement that was signed with the former.<br /><br />The KNPP is an outcome of the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) signed between India and the erstwhile USSR in 1988. However, the project construction began in 2001 and due to the non-sequential receipt of equipments from the Russian Federation the project got inordinately delayed.<br /><br />Further protests by the local villagers against the project fearing for their lives in the wake of Fukushima nuclear disaster, the commissioning of the first unit got delayed.<br /><br />In a written reply in the Lok Sabha, Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and in the Prime Minister's Office V. Narayanasamy said the cost of the first two units of KNPP is estimated to go up from Rs.13,171 crore to Rs.17,270 crore due to delay.<br />",

In Bangalore we even converted a toilet into a data receiving centre for our first satellite Aryabhata,\" U.R. Rao, former chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) told IANS.<br /><br />Today India is reckoned as a serious emerging player in the global satellite launch and manufacturing industry and the market leader in vending images sent by its remote sensing/earth observation satellites.<br /><br />Ferrying 27 foreign satellites till date, ISRO Sunday would carry a 715 kg French satellite (heaviest foreign payload to be carried by an Indian rocket) and a 15 kg Japanese micro satellite signalling the increased confidence in the space agency's rocket Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).<br /><br />The space agency has also jointly built two heavy satellites - 3,453 kg W2M and 2,541 kg Hylas - for the French agency EADS Astrium. India's high point in its space odyssey was its moon mission in 2008 when it launched Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2 is slated for 2014. The government has also sanctioned a mission to Mars which is expected to happen next year.<br /><br />But the achievement that ISRO started notching up in rocket and satellite launches since 1990s were due to the trials and tribulations that the ISRO's founding fathers underwent.<br /><br />Though ISRO has been flying sounding rockets (experimental rockets) from Thumba since 1963, its efforts to launch a rocket with a heavier payload actually started with Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3) in 1980.<br /><br />However by that time ISRO had already built and launched two satellites - 358 kg Aryabhata and 444 kg Bhaskara-1. \"Starting from the scratch was the challenge before us while we began the Aryabhata project. Majority of the team members were new to this field. The time given was just two and half years so that it could be flown in a Russian rocket. Building clean room, thermo vacuum room and other facilities were all new,\" recalled Rao.<br /><br />After Bhaskara-1 the Indian space agency built the APPLE communication satellite laid the ground for the INSAT series satellites possessing multiple capabilities - telecom, television, meteorological and imaging.<br /><br />\"Building the four-in-one satellite was a challenge. While we designed the INSAT-1A satellite it was made by Ford Aerospace and was launched by an American rocket. The satellite had a short life,\" Pramod Kale, the first project director for INSAT now retired, told IANS. Success started smiling at ISRO from INSAT-1B onwards which according to Rao ushered in communication revolution in India.<br /><br />There was no looking back for the space agency on the satellite side. From one tonne satellites, the INSAT series started growing in weight to become three tonne and ISRO later started making satellites for others.<br /><br />Meanwhile scientists at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in Thiruvananthapuram, were initially toiling to get the rocket right as the SLV and Augmented SLV (ASLV) missions gave mixed results.<br /><br />\"The two ASLV failures were the real test beds for perfecting the PSLV rocket. Issues like rocket tumbling, monitoring of rocket's main forces, detailed profiling of wind and other issues were done,\" S.C. Gupta, former director of VSSC, told IANS.<br /><br />The third ASLV with Stretched Rohini Satellite Series (SROSS) turned out to be successful but the result of the first PSLV flight in 1993 was negative owing to a software error, which was later sorted out.<br /><br />Since then there was no looking back for ISRO as far as PSLV rocket is concerned. The space agency has now three PSLV variants. \"As technology was not available we developed our own navigational systems, propellent and all the elements of the launch vehicle with help of Indian industry,\" Gupta recalled.<br /><br />But the serious issue before ISRO now is perfecting the technology for its heavier rocket Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) so that heavy communication satellites can be launched.<br /><br />\"The challenge before ISRO is to perfect its own cryogenic engine that would power the final stages of GSLV rocket. Otherwise the rocket has the same reliability like PSLV,\" B.N. Suresh, former director of VSSC and now retired, told IANS.<br />",

I will show you miracles and set everything right within a month. Just hand over the army to me,\" Thackeray, known as 'Sena-pati' claimed. <br />When he was told that his party, Shiv Sena, was an 'army', Thackeray rued the fact that it was \"unarmed\". He claimed his army had only saffron flags. \"Yet, we have so much influence, but I don't want only that, hoardings, banners and drums,\" the 86-year-old leader said.<br /><br />Thackeray claimed that the violence at Azad Maidan of Aug 11, when Muslim groups were protesting the alleged attacks on Muslims in Myanmar and the riots in Assam, was \"pre-planned,\" just like many other such incidents in the past.<br /><br />\"After Babri Mosque demolition (of December 6, 1992), they (Muslims) started riots in Mumbai. Even during the Godhra carnage, they locked up three bogies of Sabarmati Express and burnt people, women and children, alive. Similarly, the Mumbai violence (of August 2012) was pre-planned,\" Thackeray asserted.<br /><br />He said that the incident was roundly condemned by the Shiv Sena and his nephew Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, but asked, \"where were the people who paralysed Parliament,\" (referring to the Sena's ally Bharatiya Janata Party). However, Thackeray warned that he would not \"spare\" the perpetrators of violence and fanatic Muslims from Pakistan or Bangladesh who are creating trouble in the country, at least in Maharashtra.<br /><br />&quot;When I come into my element (&quot;josh&quot;), I will not allow a single fanatic Muslim to live in Maharashtra, and wherever we have party branches, right up to Jammu &amp; Kashmir,&quot; Thackeray roared through the pages of the party mouthpiece. <br /><br />He repeated his party's old stance of not permitting Pakistani cricketers to play in India. \"I have never changed my stand (on this) and will never deviate from it,\" he declared.<br /><br />Turning attention to Bihar, the Sena chief wondered why (Bihar) Chief Minister Nitish Kumar should get angry over the Maharashtra Police action of nabbing a criminal from that state.<br /><br />\"In our country, laws are made for whom, the people or dangerous terrorists? He should first think of how such terrorists could create trouble instead of raising a hue and cry over Maharashtra Police action,\" Thackeray advised. Indicating that his son Uddhav and nephew Raj were coming together, Thackeray said that the media (\"pimps and agents\") find problems even with this.<br /><br />\"Now that the two cousins are getting closer, they (media) have started devising ways to again separate them, sow differences between them and again make them fight,\" Thackeray claimed.",

The policy of allocation of coal blocks to private parties, which the CAG has criticised, was not a new policy introduced by the UPA, Moily said, adding, previous governments including NDA also allocated coal blocks through the screening committee.<br /><br />Moily said the CAG report on coal block allocations will be referred to Parliament's Public Accounts Committee and later tabled in the Lok Sabha. The CAG report had estimated an undue benefit of Rs 1.86 lakh crore to private firms in allocation of 57 coal blocks between 2005 and 2009 without competitive bidding.<br /><br />The Prime Minister had yesterday promised that issues raised in the CAG report would not be \"swept under the carpet\" and necessary \"corrective action\" will be taken even as he lashed out at BJP for pursuing obstructionist politics.",

In its report, the Tribune said the new visa agreement would \"deliver the first ever tangible results of a nascent peace process between the arch rivals that had stalled following the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\"<br /><br />The News daily reported Krishna had \"sent out positive vibes\" by telling the media soon after his arrival that India believed in a stable and prosperous Pakistan.The two countries resumed their peace process last year after a gap of over two years following the brazen assault on India's financial hub in November 2008 by operatives of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba.<br /><br />Indian sources said terrorism and the prosecution of Pakistanis involved in the Mumbai incident had figured \"in great detail\" in Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai's talks with his Pakistani counterpart Jalil Abbas Jilani.<br /><br />The Pakistani media, however, focussed on the new visa regime and other agreements for cultural exchanges between the Indian Council for Cultural Relations and the Pakistan National Council of the Arts and for allowing visits of pilgrims across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.<br /><br />The new visa regime will introduce tourist visas for the first time and include visas on arrival for people aged over 65 years.<br /><br />Group tourist visas will be issued to 10 or more people who apply through registered tour operators and multiple-city visas valid for a year will be issued to businessmen.<br /><br />The liberalised regime will include five new categories of visas while retaining several old ones, like the category for diplomatic visas.<br /><br />The new visa regime had been finalised for signing during a meeting of the Home and Interior Secretaries in May but had to be put off due to opposition from Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik, who wanted it to be inked at the political level.<br /><br />Malik told reporters yesterday that a decision to sign the pact was made when President Zardari met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the margins of the NAM Summit in Tehran recently.<br /><br />Foreign Secretary Jilani said he and his Indian counterpart had had \"positive and fruitful discussions on all aspects including Jammu and Kashmir.\" ",

Ministers of state V. Narayanasamy, Mullapally Ramachandran and Jitendra Singh were also present.<br /><br />\"The increase in communal incidents in the country in the past few months and the revival of ethnic tensions in the Northeast in recent weeks have been particular causes of concern for all of us,\" Manmohan Singh said.<br /><br />\"The ethnic disturbances of the northeast assumed a national dimension with the flight of people belonging to the northeast from various towns of South and Western India. This further strained the the communal situation in the country, which was already showing some signs of deterioration, particularly in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala,\" he said, listing the challenges before the security forces. <br /><br />In the audience as the prime minister spoke were National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon, the prime minister's principal secretary Pulok Chatterjee and Cabinet Secretary Ajith Seth. <br /><br />The prime minister's remarks come in the wake of ethnic clashes in Assam that left nearly 100 dead and another two lakh displaced, which also had a spin-off effect when rumours spread in the social media triggered an exodus of people of northeastern origin from Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai and other cities.<br /><br />\"The use of bulk SMSes and social media to aggravate the communal situation is a new challenge that the recent disturbances have thrown before us. We need to fully understand how these new media are used by miscreants,\" he said.<br /><br />\"We also need to devise strategies to counter the propaganda that is carried out by these new means. Any measure to control the use of such media must be carefully weighed against the need for freedom to express and communicate,\" he said, expressing the confidence that police forces would be able to work out effective strategies in coming months.<br /><br />\"Our country's vulnerability to cyber crime is escalating as our economy and critical infrastructure become increasingly reliant on interdependent computer networks and the internet,\" Manmohan Singh said. <br /><br />\"Large-scale computer attacks on our critical infrastructure and economy can have potentially devastating results,\" he warned the police chiefs, in the presence of ministers of state V. Narayanasamy, Mullapally Ramachandran and Jitendra Singh.<br /><br />The prime minister said the government is working on a robust cyber security structure that addresses \"threat management and mitigation, assurance and certification, capacity building and research.\"<br /><br />\"To this end, we need to build partnerships between government, academia and private sector,\" he added.<br /><br />Cyber security breaches were reported in recent months from the Visakhapatnam-based Eastern Naval Command. Regular attacks on key defence and criticial networks by hackers are also reported. <br /><br />Returning to the issue communal tensions, the prime minister said, \"the erosion of inter-community relations is something that should worry us all.\"<br /><br />\"The capacity of the administrative set-up to check such deterioration seems to have weakened,\" he said, adding that this would be true of the police administration too.<br />There is, therefore, a case for re-orienting the police forces to effectively track the sentiments of the people and inter-community tensions as they rise, he said.<br /><br />\"Advance identification of potential troublemakers, timely use of preventive sections of the law, alongside seeking cooperation of the community for maintaining peace should be the first instrument to be deployed, well before the situation deteriorates,\" he added.<br /><br />Batting for obtaining the assistance of saner elements of society to marginalise those who are overly intolerant and aggressive, Manmohan Singh called for training the police to develop soft skills.<br /><br />The prime minister also underlined the need for ordinary patrolling to gather intelligence. \"The grassroots information and intelligence collection systems that have traditionally been a part of policing have languished in some places. The role of the vigilant and effective beat constable can be vital in detecting communal tensions,\" he said. <br />",

The case is in the trial stage in a judicial magistrate court here. I will continue to pursue the matter for securing justice, for which I have been fighting for the last several years,\" he said. <br /><br />The NHRC award came as a result of a petition filed by him and its decision was pronounced in 2001. Its implementation, however, got delayed with the state government challenging it in the courts, Narayanan said, and expressed the hope that government would take a positive decision on the Court order.<br /><br />\"I am sure that I have not done anything wrong. I have been wrongly implicated in the case. You can imagine, what they (authorities) would have done had there been an iota of evidence against the accused. Even without any evidence, they had done so much damage,\" he said.<br /><br />\"How could we have illegally transferred a technology developed with the dedication and hard work of a large number of scientists for several years through two women of mere school education? When the scandal broke out in mid-1990s, no one had bothered to ask this question to us,\" he said. Narayanan said the whole scandal appeared to be the result of a \"conspiracy\" to demoralise Indian scietists. Along with this, so many external factors, including political developments took place in Kerala at the time and served as catalysts to transform into a full-blown scandal, he added.<br /><br />The Supreme Court had in 1998 found that the allegation of espionage was false and had ordered release of all accused-- Nambi Narayanan, another ISRO Scientist D Sasikumaran, two Bangalore based businessmen S K Sharma and Chandrasekharan, former IGP Ramon Srivastava and two Maldivian women Mariam Rasheeda and Fouzia Hassan.<br /><br />Following the apex court verdict, Narayanan moved NHRC for compensation.",

    "content": "As dengue cases get more widely reported across West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has earned a fresh nickname - \"Mamatadidi MBBS\". She has taken on the doctor's role, instructing people about which medicines to take and what to avoid. <br /><br />\"Didi\" (elder sister, as Banerjee is affectionately called) shows no sign of fatigue as she makes surprise visits to government and private hospitals, holds meetings through the day with health department officials and civic agencies, and briskly walks up to the podium earmarked exclusively for her at the state secretariat Writers' Buildings to brief the media.<br /><br />Local television channels have been beaming the media briefings live, and Banerjee has been using the opportunity to connect with the masses and project herself as a caring \"didi\" and capable administrator, leading the charge against the aedes aegypti. <br /><br />In her briefings, the chief minister has exhorted civic agencies to improve cleanliness and prevent accumulation of stagnant water, the breeding ground for the dengue-causing aedes aegypti mosquito. <br /><br />She has urged the public to make individual efforts to maintain hygiene. \"Keep a dustbin to gather the waste and give it to the civic staff when they come to your house or locality,\" she urges those who will listen. <br /><br />Banerjee has taken the initiative to spread awareness about the disease, its nature, the right treatment protocol and the precautions. <br /><br />This time, unlike on past occasions, the chief minister has refrained from off-the-cuff remarks. She seems to be doing meticulous homework, and her comments come inspired by discussions with officials and medical experts. <br /><br />Banerjee appears to have extensive data at her command, and she has fallen back on  support staff in case of confusion.<br /><br />Her advise to her listeners is simple and effective. Sample this: <br />. Don't panic. In case of fever, always go for blood tests. Visit government hospitals and civic body clinics for cheap tests and treatment.<br />. Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration.<br />. Don't take aspirin. That would only complicate matters.<br />. There is no medicine specifically for dengue. Take paracetamol, go for saline drips or take ORS. Take rest for at least five days.<br />. Private hospitals should treat patients with dengue-like symptoms with a humane face and bill the patients after ascertaining their financial capability.<br />Banerjee has also tasked the police with the job of stopping sale of banned drugs, which could prove fatal. She has announced that the government would come out with a list of such drugs.<br /><br />She also rapped the Trinamool Congress-run Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the Left Front-controlled neighbouring Howrah Municipal Corporation for their negligence in preventing the outbreak which has already claimed five lives and affected around 900 people across the state. <br /><br />However, unofficial figures have put the dengue toll this year at 30. Following instructions from the chief minister, civic agencies have gone on an intense drive to combat the disease. The government has splashed advertisements in the print and electronic media on the do's and dont's to prevent infection.<br /><br />Often lampooned and reviled for her many slips, intolerance of criticism and periodic foot-in-mouth syndrome, this time, the chief minister has come out blazing. There is sincere appreciation for her plainspeak and her efforts to spread awareness about dengue.<br /><br />\"It is a good effort,\" said general medicine practitioner Indranil Banerjee. Even sections of the local media, normally critical of Banerjee, have praised her. The opposition, however, has sung a different tune.<br /><br />\"I am myself a doctor, but I never even once presented my own ideas. I relied on the protocol decided by the World Health Organisation and the central health department. It seems, she is trying to play the role of a doctor without possessing any such qualification,\" said leader of the opposition Surjya Kanta Mishra, who was health minister in the Left Front regime.<br />\"Mamatadidi MBBS\" continues her work, unruffled.<br />",

Addressing the media after the  two Houses were adjourned, he called upon \"right-minded Indians to stand up and unite against the forces of anarchy and disruption to secure the foundation of our hard-earned democratic and constitutional rights\".<br /><br />The worst session of the current Lok Sabha was the Winter Session of 2010 which saw House completely paralysed due to the Opposition demand for setting up of a Joint Parliamentary Committee in to the 2G spectrum allocation scam.<br /><br />In terms of loss to the public exchequer, over Rs 126 crore were lost due to stalling and disruptions of both Houses over coal scam and other issues. The Lok Sabha lost 77 per cent of its working hours and Rajya Sabha 72 percent of their just concluded 19 days session. The cost looks to be very high as only 4 bills could be passed by both Houses.<br /><br />The government was able to introduce only four bills in Lok Sabha and two in Rajya Sabha against its target of 32 bills for introduction.   After the winding up of the monsoon session, Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal on Friday came up before media with a new computing method to calculate the cost paid in terms of money and time due to non-functioning of Parliament.<br /><br />According to him, in a year, Parliament remains in session for 80 days only, so the yearly expenditure should be calculated by assuming 80 days in a year. He said on this basis per minute expenses incurred by Parliament comes out to be Rs. 2.5 lakh. <br /><br />Hence, for 6 working hours of daily session, Parliament spends Rs. 9 crores. Parliament lost nearly 75 percent of this session which puts the amount of lost money over 128 crores.<br /><br />Bansal lamented that Parliament was expected to pass 15-20 bills in this session, but passed only 4 bills. \"We had identified 32 Bills for introduction and expected to get 15-20 bills passed,\" said the minister.<br /><br />Some important bills which were  to be passed in this session include The Banking  Laws Amendment Bill, the Marriage Law Amendment Bill related to  divorce and the Prevention of Money Laundering Bill.<br /><br />According to the details provided by Rajya Sabha, the House sat for 29 hours and lost 62 hours of its 19 sittings.

The working groups, which have been holding meetings, will report the progress of the negotiations to them.<br /><br />Terrorism issue<br /><br />Krishna will raise the issue of terrorism and express his concern over the seeming lack of interest in Pakistan in bringing to book the perpetrators of the 26/11 carnage in Mumbai, while Pakistan is expected to maintain that it was in the judicial domain and the government, like in India, would not be able to do much on it.<br /><br />Rabbani, in an interview on Friday, said her government had not left any stone unturned in the case.<br /><br />Pakistan on its part, will bring up the Jammu and Kashmir issue as Rabbani said it was the core issue for her government.<br /><br />The withdrawal of troops from Siachen would figure in the talks among other issues. However, the use of social media and sending of hate SMS and email issues, allegedly by groups in Pakistan to whip up communal passion in India, are unlikely to figure in the talks. The issue of 26/11 terrorist Abu Jundal is also unlikely to come up.<br /><br />Foreign secretaries of the two countries &amp;mdash; Ranjan Mathai and Jalil Abbas Jilani &amp;mdash; met on Friday ahead of Saturday's high-level talks.<br /><br />Separatist warns Indo-Pak leadership<br /><br />Ahead of Indo-Pak foreign ministers talks in Islamabad, hardline separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani on Friday warned both countries against pronouncing any \"readymade solution\" to the Kashmir issue, reports DHNSfrom Srinagar.<br /><br />\"I warn both countries that the people of Kashmir will never compromise on the movement and the countless sacrifices made so far.

They will be discussed in Parliament as they should be. Whatever corrective action is necessary will be taken,\" Singh told journalists after both the Houses of Parliament adjourned sine die. <br /><br />\"We have had one wasted session. I hope parliament can get back to business in the next session. Meanwhile, the Government must act wherever it can without the benefit of parliamentary guidance,\" he said.<br /><br />As lack of political consensus and logjam in Parliament stalled the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance Government's reform agenda, Prime Minister said all the Ministries of the Union Government were being instructed to accelerate the process of considering \"critical issues where decisions\" were \"needed to get the economy moving again\".<br /><br />The key Bills - like Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill and the Companies Bill - were stalled, either due to lack of consensus within the UPA as well as ruckus over Coalgate in Parliament.<br /><br />The Government was relying on the Bills to boost the economy that decelerated to a nine-year low of 5.3 per cent in the last quarter of 2011-12 and could recover slightly in the first quarter of 2012-13.<br /><br />Also pending are Food Security Bill, Lokpal Bill and a slew of other anti-graft legislations that the ruling Congress-led coalition was hoping to rely on to salvage its scam-tainted image and ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.<br /><br />Boosting investment<br /><br />The Prime Minister said his Government could bring back the growth momentum and encourage entrepreneurship by stimulating investment in infrastructure, power, roads, ports, railways, and telecommunications. \"This will send a clear signal to the world that India is on the road to recovery. This, in turn, will bring back the momentum of growth, generate productive employment and also enable us to direct more resources to help the poor and weaker sections,\" he added.  <br /><br />The Government could not bring the economy on the path of recovery, if it was \"constantly distracted by the actions of those who prefer obstruction over discussion,\" Singh added.<br /><br />\"Our job in Government, I have always maintained, is to grapple with the problems of mass poverty, ignorance and disease, which still afflict millions of our citizens. We will not be distracted from this task,\" said the Prime Minister.  <br /><br />A report of the Comptroller and Accountant General on allocation of coal blocks between 2006 and 2009 was tabled in Parliament on August 17 last. The report criticized the Government for its delay in introducing competitive bidding and replacing opaque and questionable system of allocating coal blocks through the Inter-Ministerial Screening Committee. It calculated that the private companies, which had been allocated coal blocks, had made a windfall gain of Rs 1,86,000 crore due to the delay by the Government.<br /><br />The CAG's report prompted the BJP to up its ante against the Congress-led Government and to demand resignation of Prime Minister, who held the coal portfolio during time covered by the audit. Rejecting the Government's offer for a discussion on the CAG's report in Parliament, the principal opposition party disrupted the proceedings of both the Houses.<br />",

The other is battling for life.<br /><br />The gunmen have been identified as Rajbir Sharma, 30, father of two, who runs a small transport business, and his friend Manish Sharma, 23, both residents of the village. The shooting spree that killed four people lasted half an hour.<br /><br />At 4 pm, Rajbir and Manish, riding on a motorcycle, first went to Kishan Sharma's house and shot him. Kishan Sharma, 38, is Rajbir's elder brother.<br /><br />Rajbir had planned to kill Kishan over an ongoing ancestral property dispute. Rajbir's father had been living with Kishan ever since the dispute started. Rajbir and Manish then fled from Kishan's house on a motorcycle. They straight away went to 23-year-old Jyoti Yadav's house, which was 200 metres from Kishan's house. They knocked her door and asked members of her family to call her. Later, then Manish shot her. Jyoti's fault was that Manish wanted to marry her, but her parents had fixed her marriage with another man. <br /><br />The girl got engaged last month, and was scheduled to get married on November 19. After her marriage was fixed, Manish had gone to her house and warned everyone of dire consequences.<br /><br />The two killers then rode towards the highway, when they came across Usha Yadav, 25, a teacher with a private school in Model Town, and also a resident of Swaroop Nagar. <br /><br />They stopped their bike and shot her. Apparently, Rajbir was infatuated with her. The two men then returned to Rajbir's house. Rajbir entered the house and shot his three-year-old daughter Rashi, eight-year-old daughter Khushi and 25-year-old wife Pooja.<br /><br />Then Manish and Rajbir decided to shoot themselves. \"Khushi, Jyoti, Usha and Rajbir were killed in the incident, while Pooja, Rashi, Kishan and Manish are undergoing treatment for critical injuries,\" said a senior police official.<br /><br />All the victims were initially taken to Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital, and the critically injured were later shifted to Lok Nayak Hospital.<br /><br />Police are probing the matter and trying to ascertain the exact sequence of events.

Such an environment has been created by these politicians,\" the former Team Anna member said.<br /><br />Justifying the decision to form political party and contest elections, Kejriwal said said \"we had tried all possible ways to deal with the government on the Janlokpal issue.

The cause of the repeated disruption was that we had received a report of the CAG on the allocation of coal blocks which alleged some infirmities in the process. <br /><br />Instead of discussing this report in the PAC, which is the normal procedure, or even discussing it immediately in Parliament, which we offered to do, leaders of the opposition saw fit to demand my resignation before Parliament was even allowed to take a view on the report.<br /><br />I feel very strongly that this is making a mockery of parliamentary democracy. We take pride in our parliamentary democracy and the tradition of free debate that it implies. Only a few months ago, during the 60th year celebrations of our Parliament, I said that the story of the Indian Parliament is a story of India striving for freedom and dignity; for tolerance and equality; for peace and progress.<br /><br />We do not live up to these high ideals if we simply do not let Parliament function. The Government and the opposition both have a sacred obligation to strengthen our parliamentary system. We do incalculable damage to the reputation of India's Parliament if we resort to disruption of Parliament to make a political point.<br /><br />Those who prevent Parliament from functioning, disable the voice of the people. They take away their right to hear their representatives debate issues in a reasoned manner when the case for and against a point of view can be heard. They force them to listen instead only to voices in the street, which is not the place for reasoned discourse.<br /><br />This is the road to a dysfunctional politics which will only produce agitational politics and a deeply divided and disenchanted country.<br /><br />I have high respect for the CAG as an institution. I believe we strengthen it only by taking its reports seriously enough to discuss them in the PAC and in the House. PAC reports deal with complex issues on which there can be different points of view and all these must be heard fully before rushing to judgement. We do not strengthen the CAG as an institution by using its reports to prevent discussion and cause disruption.<br /><br />I assure all of you that the issues raised in the CAG report are not being swept under the carpet. They will be discussed in parliament as they should be. Whatever corrective action is necessary will be taken.<br /><br />We are faced with many internal and external problems and challenges. There are problems of communal tension, ethnic violence and the ever present threat of Naxalism. Terrorism remains a serious threat.

India added its own traditions of Sabha and Samiti (local bodies of governance) to the democratic system.<br /><br />The president said every modern nation is a product of assimilation and India has led in civilizational interaction with other parts of the world.<br /><br />The 21st edition of three-week KIP has participants of Indian origin from 11 countries such as New Zealand, Surinam, Malaysia, Fiji, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, Iran, Slovak Republic and Israel. All are in the 18-26 age group.<br /><br />KIP's objective is to introduce India to the youth of Indian origin living abroad and to link the youth diaspora with their country of origin.<br /><br />Under the present edition, the participants will visit Tamil Nadu to see and experience historical, cultural, industrial and administrative institutions. They will also interact with the Indian media, visit NGOs and women's movements.<br /><br />The first leg of this edition of KIP began on Aug 29 and ended with the participants' interaction with Mukherjee.<br /><br />The visitors will visit their host state from Sep 8 to 15 and return to the national capital to share their experiences with the MOIA officials from Sep 16 to 18.<br />",

Nambi Narayanan, one of the main accused in the 1994 ISRO spy case who was later absolved of all charges.<br /><br />While it asked for the money to be paid in three weeks time, the court overruled the NHRC directive to take action against those who had charged two ISRO scientists in the case.<br /><br />\"I always believed in the judiciary and this shows that the system functions.

But what we have witnessed in this session is total negation of that,\" Manmohan Singh said outside parliament.<br /><br />BJP members continued with their demand for Manmohan Singh's resignation triggered by the Aug 17 Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) report of a Rs.1.86 lakh crore ($37 billion) presumptive loss in coal block allocations.<br /><br />Beginning Aug 21, no day went by in parliament without the BJP MPs trooping towards the presiding officers' chairs raising slogans, forcing adjournments.<br /><br />The government, which slammed the BJP for disrupting parliament, wanted the opposition to come to the house and debate the coal blocks allocation. But that was not to be.<br /><br />\"We have great respect for the institution of the CAG and we do respect this institution. We must be willing to debate its finding in the Public Accounts Committee and even on the floor of the parliament which we have always been willing,\" the prime minister said.<br /><br />Reacting sharply to the prime minister's criticism, the BJP said it was its democratic right to protest, including inside parliament, against corruption.<br /><br />\"I would like to remind the prime minister, when he was leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, they had stalled parliament over the Tehelka issue. Even over the coffin scam, they stalled parliament and called us coffin thieves,\" Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said. <br /><br />She was referring to the 2001 sting operation by web portal Tehelka exposing bribery in defence purchases, after which then defence minister George Fernandes had to resign, and the scandal over money being siphoned for the purchase of coffins for martyrs of the Kargil battle. <br /><br />\"Not allowing parliament to function is also a form of democracy like any other form,\" Sushma Swaraj added.<br /><br />Backing her, BJP leader Arun Jaitley called irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks, a \"textbook case of crony capitalism\".<br /><br />The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, amid all the din in the two houses, could get only six bills passed during the entire session, though it had set for itself a target of getting 30 draft legislations considered and passed.<br /><br />It could also get six bills introduced in parliament, including the draft legislation for providing quotas to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes during promotions in government jobs, a move that divided its own allies.<br /><br />While the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was all for the law, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the DMK wanted similar quotas for other backward classes.<br /><br />When the quota bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha, Bahujan Samaj Party's (BSP) Avtar Singh Hakimpuri and Samajwadi Party's (SP) Naresh Agrawal got into an ugly scuffle.<br /><br />The government had planned to introduce at least 15 bills in the session.<br /><br />Around 100 bills are pending before parliament, including some over 20 years old, such as the ones on land acquisition, Lokpal, whistle blowers, money-laundering, companies, banking and forward contracts regulation.",

    "content": "BJP today defended the washout of nearly the entire Monsoon Session of Parliament by the Opposition saying a similar exercise in 2010 on the 2G spectrum issue had led to cleansing of the telecom sector and hoped it will bring transparency in allocation of natural resources.<br /><br />At a session-end press conference here, Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj and her Rajya Sabha counterpart Arun Jaitley attacked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the UPA government for the reported anomalies in coal block allocations.<br /><br />BJP announced that it will take the fight to the streets and from \"village to village\" after not allowing Parliament to function.<br /><br />The main opposition maintained it is not in favour of disrupting Parliament often and it should be resorted to in the \"rarest of rare cases\" but insisted that the 2G spectrum scam and now the coal scam demanded this.<br /><br />\"One session of Parliament has earlier been lost on account of corruption in allotment of 2G spectrum. That helped this country to cleanse the telecom sector. Hopefully, the long term gains of this session may enable future governments to clean up the process of allocation of natural resources,\" Jaitley said.<br /><br />Terming the allotment of coal blocks as arbitrary and discretionary, he alleged that these took place \"under the very nose of the Prime Minister who also held the coal portfolio\" are textbook case of \"crony capitalism\".<br /><br />The party suggested that the government institute a commission of inquiry into coal scam and the Prime Minister depose before it.<br /><br />BJP leader M Venkaiah Naidu told reporters outside Parliament that the party will now go to the streets to make people aware of the government's \"wrong doings\" on various fronts.<br /><br />\"We are not demanding mid-term polls but we want the government to go. The reason being the government has not only failed on all fronts but is also deeply involved in corruption,\" he said.<br /><br />The BJP leaders alleged that government had allocated coal blocks to politicians and business persons close to the UPA.<br /><br />\"Many (allottees) have nothing to do with either steel or power sectors. Many were name-lenders and rentiers. They used their political clout to get an allocation, either in their own name or in the name of a joint venture. And then they exited after a windfall gain,\" Jaitley alleged.<br /><br />The party maintained that it was forced to disrupt Parliament as being the principal opposition it could not remain silent. \"We used this session of Parliament to shake the conscience of the people of India and appealed to the government to correct the monumental fraud committed on public exchequer,\" Swaraj said.<br /><br />BJP will chalk out the contours of its plan for taking the issue to the people at its Core Group meeting next week. The party sees more potential of reaching out to the people and attacking the Congress-led UPA on the coal block allocation issue than the earlier the 2G spectrum scam which was esoteric and difficult to comprehend for the common man.<br /><br />The opposition continued its tirade against the Prime Minister and maintained that either he himself or the PMO is the \"kingpin\" of the delay in implementing the auction system for allocating coal blocks. It referred to the minutes of a July 25, 2005 meeting in the PMO to claim that this \"conclusively establishes\" this allegation.<br /><br />\"They (PM and PMO) were aware of the fact that competitive bidding will only transfer the windfall gains to the government exchequer and not hike the power rates,\" Jaitley said.<br /><br />The party alleged that cancellation of coal block allotments is \"nowhere among the Prime Minister's priorities\" and pressed for his resignation. BJP maintained that cancellation of these allotments will have a beneficial impact on the economy as auctions will bring more revenue. <br /><br />Justifying the disruptions in Parliament, BJP said it may have caused a loss of few crores but in the 2G case there will be a gain of lakhs of crores as the government goes for auctions with Rs 14,000 crore as the base price.<br /><br />A similar outcome can be expected on the coal issue, Swaraj said.<br />\"UPA is a regime which is committed to kleptocracy. This is what they have done to the country,\" Jaitley said.<br /><br />Swaraj maintained that the UPA is only a trustee of the people and the exchequer is not their fiefdom. She alleged that the charges in the coal scam go upto the doors of the Congress.<br /><br />The main opposition party stood by its Rajya Sabha MP Ajay Sancheti who was alloted a coal block in Chhattisgarh, saying his company had acquired it through competitive bidding and he was only a minority shareholder. It said all coal allocations should be probed.<br /><br />The party also termed the inter-ministerial group (IMG) looking into the coal block allocations an \"eyewash\" saying the issue here is not of squatting on mines and not engaging in mining but of arbitrary allocations.<br /><br />Asked about Prime Minister Singh's charge that Parliament did not function due to the Opposition, Jaitley said, \"You can slightly amend it. The House did not run due to corruption.\"<br /><br />He claimed that the party had set the agenda on the coal block allocation issue and this had made parties like SP and the Left also oppose the government on the issue.<br /><br />Jaitley denied that that the BJP wanted to go it alone in the fight against the UPA government, saying, \"Our preference is not for isolation.\" He expressed gratitude to parties like AIADMK and the NDA allies for espousing the cause.",

Parliament was not allowed to discuss these important issues before the country,\" he said.<br /><br />Singh said the government was trying to prevent India getting affected by difficulties like recession faced by the global economy.<br /><br />\"Parliament should have discussed these issues. What is our economic strategy to deal with these global developments, Parliament was not allowed to do any of these things,\" he said.<br /><br />\"The result is Parliament -- a forum where we articulate our peoples' felt needs and felt urges -- was totally paralysed,\" Singh said.<br />",

The Prime Minister and Leader of Lok Sabha Sushilkumar Shinde were present when the House was adjourned.<br /><br />Observing that the data on work done was \"in no need of commentary\", Ansari regretted that 62 hours were lost in the din during the session which began on August 8. Only three bills could be passed. While Question Hour was taken up once in the 19-day session, only 11 out of 399 starred questions could be taken up.<br /><br />The Constitution amendment bill for providing reservation in promotions to SCs and STs was introduced amid high drama with the Upper House proceedings witnessing a new low with SP and BSP members coming to fisticuffs.<br /><br />The measure could not be taken up for consideration and passage, despite being listed for the last three days due to vociferous protests by SP and Shiv Sena. BSP supremo Mayawati's suggestion to extend the session for passage of the bill did not find favour among other parties. <br /><br />The controversy over coal block allocation continued even though Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made a statement in both Houses of Parliament on August 27 in the light of the CAG report.<br /><br />A highlight of the session was the bonhomie between the ruling alliance and the Opposition witnessed during the unanimous election of P J Kurien as the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha on August 21.<br /><br />It was again visible today on the last day of the session, when the Opposition greeted Kurien as sat next to Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitely.<br /><br />Both the Houses of Parliament showed solidarity with the people of North East, with Rajya Sabha adopting a unanimous resolution demanding a thorough probe into the spread of rumours that created panic and assuring them that they are safe anywhere in the country, while urging them to go back to their places of work and study.<br /><br />The session also saw Cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar beginning his innings as an MP when he attended Rajya Sabha as its member. Nominated to the Upper House in April, he had taken oath during the inter-session period.<br /><br />The Whistle Blowers Protection Bill, aimed at protecting those exposing corruption, could not be passed as discussions remained incomplete on this anti-graft measure.<br />Though the government had listed around 30 bills for consideration and passing in Lok Sabha, only four bills were passed in the month-long session and that too in din without any discussion.<br /><br />The Rajya Sabha could pass only three bills including the AIIMS amendment bill. Two bills - Armed Forces Tribunal (Amendment) Bill and the Constitution (117th rpt 117th) Amendment bill to provide quota in promotion to SCs/STs - could only be introduced. The last three days saw commotion and drama in the Upper House over quota in promotion bill.",

This means, rest of the 49.84 lakh tonnes was illegally shipped out by these companies in the active connivance of government officials, the report observed.  <br /><br />Noting that illegal iron ore was transported from Bellary district to Belekeri port by using five lakh trucks during 2009 to mid 2010, the panel said this was not possible without the connivance of officials, exporters and transporters.<br /><br />The panel suggested that the CBI investigate four companies (those exporting five lakh and above), and conduct preliminary inquiry into 18 companies that exported 1 lakh to five lakh tonnes.<br /><br />If the findings were serious, the CBI could go ahead with probe or else it can refer the cases to Karnataka Government for further action, the CEC said.<br /><br />As for 51 companies that exported less than one lakh tonnes, the Karnataka Government can initiate the probe and take action against culprits.<br /><br />The panel named four exporters who were allegedly found to have illegally exported 5 lakh tonnes and above iron ore. They are ILC Industries Ltd (9.86 lakh tonnes), Dream Logistics Company (India) Pvt Ltd (9.16 lakh tonnes), SB Logistics (7.74 lakh tonnes) and Shree Mallikarjuna Shipping Pvt Ltd (7.23 lakh tonnes). <br /><br />The four companies exported 33.98 lakh tonnes from January 1, 2009 to May 31, 2010 from Belekeri Port. \"These companies have also received receipt/transfer of money within and outside the country... the CBI probe may be ordered against all illegalities of these firms\", the panel said.<br /><br />Extend probe<br /><br />The panel also suggested that if the CBI required, it can extend its probe against other firms who exported iron ore prior to January 2009, including Swastik Steels Private Limited, Swastik Cement and Minerals, SMSK Mineral Trading Company, Eagle Traders, Manjunatheshwara Minerals, Saifa Minerals, Gem Laboratories Private Limited, and Greentex Mining Industries Limited.  <br /><br />The CEC also suggested that the CBI investigate the case of illegal export of seized iron ore from Belekeri port.

Even cell-phones or pagers are not allowed anywhere near the sheds, the sources added.  <br /><br />The sources said preminary inquiry showed that the unit had a larger quantity of chemicals than allowed and employed more people than permiitted in the licence. The sources said, \"Our experts are on the field; it is hard to pin-point the exact trigger now as the explosion was so huge and the fire so intense.\" <br /><br />The fire was the worst in Virdhunagar district in two decades.

The smackings were so hard that blood started oozing out of the junior officer's ears and had to be hospitalised.<br /><br />Warsi, the Chief of Staff of the Coast Guard in Andaman, was irked by the young assistant commandant's questions on operational issues. The DIG asked him to \"shut up\" till he finished his briefing. But as the commandant kept on asking, he slapped him, stunning everybody at the meeting.<br /><br />The young officer did not comment or retaliate. But as the briefing resumed, he raised questions again. An angry Warsi hit him twice very hard after which blood started oozing out of his ear. The commandant was admitted in naval hospital INS Dhanvantari in Port Blair on the same day. On September 2, a board of inquiry was ordered and the DIG was transfered to the Coast Guard unit in Mumbai. The incident of blind rage in the armed forces came to the light on a day when Antony reviewed the working conditions in the armed forces to find out the reason behind the fratricide and suicide cases in the forces,  many of which are triggered by stress.<br /><br />The minister asked the three services and Defence Institute of Psychological Research in Delhi to find out reasons behind increasing stress level among officers and steps need to be taken to bring it down.<br /><br />While a stressed-out soldier or sailor or airman can seek advice and counsel from his senior officers, there are not much options for the officers, particularly those who are posted in forward units or in the high-seas.  The three services have also been instructed to pay immediate attention to leave application requests filed by soldiers. Antony would write to the Railway Minister asking him to ensure confirmed tickets for soldiers returning home.<br /><br />In the last 12 years, Army lost 1,158 men out of which 1,082 died in fratricide while 76 were suicides.",

The article has been updated,\" said the correction.<br /><br />Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister's Office lodged a protest with \"The Post\" against the news report, for the journalist's failure to accommodate the government's version and use information published in an Indian magazine eight months ago. The article, which trigged angry reaction within the government and the Congress described Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as a \"tragic figure\" and \"a dithering, ineffectual bureaucrat presiding over a deeply corrupt government.\"<br /><br />Rebutting the article published in the US daily on Wednesday, the PMO said the write-up was \"one-sided assessment\" of Singh.<br /><br />\"Despite all lines of conversations open, you never got in touch with us for our side of the story though you regularly talk to me about information from the PMO. We do not complain about criticism of the government which is a journalist's right,\" Pankaj Pachauri, PM's Communications Adviser, said in his letter to Simon Denyer, author of the report and India bureau chief of The Post.<br /><br />Denyer, however, remained unfazed by the PMO's rebuttal. \"I stand by the story,\" he said in his reply, posted on the website of the US daily along with PMO's rebuttal.<br /><br />He said he had requested for an interview with the Prime Minister on three occasions. He had also requested for an interview with PM's advisor T K A Nair and principal secretary Pulok Chatterji.<br /><br />Accepting that Denyer's interview request was declined, the PMO, however, contended that an e-mail reply to his request clearly stated the interview was declined till the Monsoon Session of the Parliament.<br /><br />\"At that stage the Monsoon Session of Parliament had not even begun. In any case my story touches on the fact that Parliament has been adjourned every day throughout the current session by opposition calls for the PM to resign, which is a story I felt should be told, interview or not,\" Denyer said countering the charge.<br /><br />Singh's former media adviser Sanjaya Baru complained that his eight-month old quote from an Indian Magazine (Caravan) was \"rehashed and used\" in the article.<br /><br />Denyer quoted Baru as saying that Singh had become an object of ridicule and endured the worst period in his life. Baru's assertion first appeared in the Caravan magazine last year. \"I spoke to Baru personally on the telephone during the reporting for the story. He confirmed that these sentiments were accurate,\" Denyer contended.<br /><br />The Post used an old quote of historian Ramachandra Guha in the same magazine. Guha was quoted as saying that Singh was handicapped by his \"timidity, complacency and intellectual dishonesty.\"<br /><br />Singh will go down in history as India's first Sikh prime minister and the country's third-longest-serving premier, but also as someone who did not know when to retire, Guha said.<br />",

To buck the trend, it was necessary to \"counter-radicalise\" and \"de-radicalise\" youth, he added.<br /><br />The IB chief drew the attention of the security managers at the Centre and state levels of the need for a comprehensive pre-emptive strategy to redress the grievances of youth.<br /><br /> Sources said the strategy would focus on development and education, as well as instilling confidence in them to overcome any feelings of persecution. <br /><br />The plan, which is at a nascent stage, will take shape in a month and will then be circulated among other stakeholders for action, added the sources.<br /><br />The other key topic Sandhu focussed on was use of social media to create unrest in the country in the wake of violence in Assam. <br /><br />Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde shared the IB director's concern, acknowledging that cyber world was being used by terrorists for posting \"motivated rumours\" which posed a new challenge to the security forces.<br /><br />\"There is increasing evidence of terrorists using cyber space. The recent incidents in Bangalore in Karnataka, Pune in Maharashtra and other states of India where motivated rumours and irresponsible use of the social networking media posted a new challenge...Police will have to develop skills in this area not just for locating malicious content but also for identifying those responsible for posting it,\" Shinde remarked.<br /><br />He also said that Maoism continues to pose significant challenge.<br /><br />\"There are indications about increase in the number of trained and armed cadres, reorganization of military potential for formation of new battalions, and creation of well developed indigenous capacity to their arsenal,\" he stated.<br /><br />Shinde cautioned chiefs of states police and paramilitary forces against leaking information to media before investigation into cases are complete.<br /><br />This comes a few days after the Karnataka government and the police were found virtually running a daily bulletin on the probe developments into the arrests of 12 terror suspects. \"Premature exposure of such intelligence can retard and even defeat the possibility of interdiction. Similarly, revealing of clues as collected by painstaking investigations to the print and electronic media alerts other conspirators and blunts the momentum of investigations,\" Shinde remarked. <br /><br />He said that even the novel techniques evolved by investigators are eroded by the \"indiscriminate disclosure of specifics in the public domain\".  <br /><br />The IB view<br /><br />* Youth are vulnerable to radicals and fundamentalists. It is necessary to \"de-radicalise\" them.<br /><br />* The cyberworld is increasingly used to post rumours.<br /><br />* The strategy will focus on development, education and instilling confidence in youth to overcome feelings of persecution.<br />",

Out of the 1,500-odd acres of agriculture land that was acquired for the nuclear power project, \"beneficiaries\" of nearly 1,350 acres have already accepted compensation cheques. The remaining farmers, the government hopes, will follow suit shortly. On Thursday, ground survey work at the nuclear project site in Fatehabad district finally commenced, post a small ceremony.<br /><br />The long agitation by effected farmers had witnessed violence, death, political overtones and high-decibel rhetoric from several quarters, including members of disbanded Team Anna, that promised little hope for the project. Until recently, cane-wielding women guarding fertile farmland and threatening havoc at any attempt to take away their land was a common site in Gorakhpur village in the district. Today, there appears to be calm and the compensation that farmers have got from the government is spilling dreams of a prosperous tomorrow. The 2800 MW Haryana Atomic Power Project (HAPP) is being set up by Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL). The first phase of this nuclear power project is expected to be commissioned by 2018, inform sources.  <br /><br />The agitation started to lose steam once the government announced a lucrative compensation package. For effected farmers, it was an offer hard to ignore given that real estate prices in this area have been anything but lucrative. Officials say farmers have got about Rs 31 lakh per acre compensation and another Rs 4 lakh per acre as \"no litigation allowance\". The farmers would also get Rs 21,000 per acre annually for 33 years with an annual increase of increase Rs 750 an acre.<br /><br />The accumulative compensation would add up to over Rs 46 lakh per acre. The government would also provide farmers land for constructing a house if their house was acquired. Be it a new tubewell or a fruit tree on the acquired land, the government has accounted for a compensation. Officials say the authorities will not levy any stamp duty or registration fee if they purchase land with the compensation money. <br />",

The film appears to be a take-off on a hit Telugu film starring Srikanth with the same title which dealt with political corruption.<br /><br />Sources in Tollywood say that Kiran's supporters within the ruling Congress have pooled in resources to fund the movie project. The move comes at a time when the 53-year-old Kiran, is facing a tough political challenge in the wake of efforts by his detractors to unseat him. <br /><br />There has been a growing demand from a section of the State Congress leaders for a change of guard. The party's drubbing in the recent by-election and the growing dissidence have added to his woes. The movie narrates how the chief minister single-handedly takes on the corrupt elements within the government, ensures that the scamsters are sent to jail and saves the state exchequer from plunder. <br /><br />The film's sub-text also deals with the ongoing CBI investigation into the illegal assets case against the YSR Congress Party President and Kadapa MP YS Jagan Mohan Reddy who has emerged as a major challenger to the ruling Congress. It is said that popular actor Jagapati Babu will play the role of CBI Joint Director.",

It also bans the sale and purchase of the products near educational institutions. <br /><br />As per the law, a fine up to Rs 200 is imposed for smoking in public and sale of tobacco products to minors.<br /><br />Bihar had recently banned sale of gutkha and other similar products containing tobacco or nicotine after it was reported that consumption of tobacco in the state was highest in the country.

The Ministry had cleared the proposal in April this year.<br /><br />With today's decision, Air India would begin the process of transferring the assets and manpower to AIESL and AITSL, which would be treated as separate profit centres.<br />AIESL would carry out Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) business, not only for Air India but other airlines too and tap the potential of nearly USD 1.5 billion MRO business in the Asia-Pacific Region.<br /><br />At present, Indian carriers have to send most of their planes to Europe and even Dubai and Singapore to get them repaired or for mandatory checks.<br /><br />Air India would provide AIESL an equity of Rs 375 crore for capital expenditure over a period of three years, sources said, adding that this would be based on equity support received by the national carrier from the government. The subsidiary is projected to make profits in five years. About 7,000 employees of Air India would migrate to it.<br /><br />AITSL, which would carry out the ground handling services, would be provided equity worth Rs 393 crore by Air India over 12 years. About 12,000 employees will shift to it. This new subsidiary is projected to make profits from the current financial year itself, the sources said.<br /><br />Air India has a total staff strength of about 29,000. It's aircraft-manpower ratio last year was 263 as against 150 in Jet Airways, 111 in Kingfisher and 102 in Indigo.<br /><br />With the hiving off, this ratio is expected to come down considerably, the sources said.<br /><br />Air India, which reported an estimated loss of Rs 7853 crore in 2011-12, has an accumulated loss of Rs 20,000 crore over the past five years. Under the government-approved turnaround and financial restructuring plans, a total equity infusion of Rs 30,000 crore has been planned till 2021.",

Shah was in the Gujarat cabinet when the killing took place.<br /><br />The court asked Shah's counsel Ram Jethmalani: \"How do you assure that if we allow you outside that you will not interfere with the course of the trial?\"<br /><br />\"You (Amit Shah) are a political person. You are an influential person,\" the court said.<br />Jethmalani said on Shah's behalf: \"I am not an influential person. Had I been so, I would not be in a position that I am in.\"<br /><br />He told the court that Shah would give an undertaking that he would not interfere with the course of trial or subvert it as was being alleged by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).<br /><br />If Shah) breaches it, Jethmalani said, he would not appear to defend him but to prosecute him.<br /><br />Taking exception to the conduct of the Gujarat government, the court said that  instead of being an ally of the court in reaching to the bottom of the case it had acted in an adversarial manner, often adopting a hostile attitude.<br /><br />Shah was named as an accused in Sohrabuddin Sheikh's killing in which the CBI described him as a head of an extortion syndicate in Gujarat. Shah was arrested by the probe agency July 25, 2010 for his alleged involvement in Sohrabuddin's killing.<br /><br />The former minister told the court: \"I have no objection in being tried by any court in Maharashtra but my bail may not be disturbed.\"<br /><br />The court wanted to know the position of the CBI which had opposed the grant of bail to Shah.<br /><br />Appearing for the CBI, senior counsel Vivek Tankha said that it was a triple murder case and any grant of bail to Shah would influence the charge sheet in the 2006 Tulsiram Prajapati alleged staged shootout case. The probe agency's reference to triple murder included the killings of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, his wife Kausar Bi and Sohrabuddin's aide Tulsiram Prajapati.<br /><br />Reiterating its plea for the cancellation of Shah's bail, Tankha told the court: \"We have faced a lot of problems at the hands of the administration and we will continue to face it. The whole administrative machinery revolves around Amit Shah.\"<br /><br />\"The magnitude of the state influence gets further magnified by the CBI charge sheet in Tulsiram Prajapati case,\" Tankha told the court, pointing to \"evidence on record of collusion/connivance of senior functionaries/officials in the state administration to derail the investigation\".<br /><br />Tankha told the court that if Shah's bail was not cancelled then other accused police officers in custody would also seek relief.<br /><br />The CBI told the court that they would take another four weeks in completing the investigation into the involvement of Andhra Pradesh police officials in the Sohrabuddin  case and in all six weeks to commence trial in the Tulsiram Prajapati case.<br /><br />Amicus Curiae Gopal Subramaniam told the court that the conduct of the Gujarat government was evident from the judicial records of the apex court and orders passed by it. <br /><br />He said that it was only in March 23, 2007 that the state government said that it was possible that some police officials may have committed the crime and it was being investigated.<br /><br />The court noted that earlier the Gujarat government was in a strong denial mode.<br />\"It was the state that was in mode of denial and you are holding against this person (Amit Shah). If you can say that all earlier denials were attributable to him, that will make the case...,\" Justice Alam said.<br /><br />Subramaniam said: \"At least I may not establish whether the state of denial was attributable to him (Amit Shah) but there is a commonality of position.\"<br /><br />Sohrabuddin was killed by Gujarat Police Nov 25, 2005, in a staged shootout.

No police complaint has been lodged in this regard, Rao said.<br /><br />The NIT Director felt some anti-social elements were trying to destabilise the institute and bring disrepute to it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, around 40 activists of some student organisations were taken into custody by police after they stormed into the Administrative Block of the NIT and allegedly tried to manhandle Rao and ransack the premises protesting against what they called failure of NIT authorities in not controlling ragging incidents.",

Krishna heads for Islamabad Friday to meet his Pakistan counterpart Hina Rabbani Khar in yet another attempt at fence-mending between the two wary South Asian neighbours.<br /><br />The Indian side has made it clear that terrorism, and particularly the Mumbai terror attack, would remain a \"core issue\" as both sides review the second round of the dialogue process, revived in February 2011 after a long hiatus following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.<br /><br />\"All issues are going to be discussed. Terrorism is certainly a core concern to us. Mumbai (26/11 trial) is a core concern to us,\" well-placed sources said here.<br /><br />They said that terrorism issues will not take a backseat despite the increase in trade activity between both countries in recent months.<br /><br />Krishna begins his three-day visit to Pakistan Friday. While the foreign secretaries - India's Ranjan Mathai and Pakistan's Jalil Abbas Jilani - will meet Friday, the foreign ministers will hold talks Saturday.<br /><br />Krishna, who was last in Pakistan in July 2011, spends some time in Lahore Sunday on the way back. He will meet with political, business and civil society leaders in Lahore in an opportunity to feel the pulse of Pakistani civil society.<br /><br />Both ministers will also co-chair the plenary of the India-Pakistan Joint Commission Saturday.<br /><br />It is not clear whether Krishna will carry any evidence to back the home ministry's contention that a spate of recent hate messages spread through social media networks emanated from Pakistani territory. The messages had triggered the exodus of people from the northeast from southern cities like Bangalore, Pune and Hyderabad.<br /><br />The sources, however, did not clarify whether the much-awaited new visa agreement will be signed during this visit. However, India hopes it will be signed as early as possible. <br />The visa agreement was supposed to be signed during the home secretaries level talks held in May in Pakistan, but could not be done as Pakistan insisted that it should be done at the political level.<br /><br />Other issues likely to figure in the talks are confidence building measures (CBMs), release of prisoners as well as trade and border issues.<br /><br />Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who met Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari on the sidelines of the NAM summit in Tehran last week, said the expeditious conclusion of the Mumbai terror attack trial will be a \"major\" confidence building measure in bilateral relations.",

Chandhok that the I-T Department does not prepare the transcripts but merely hears them and prepares a report on relevant material for appraisal by the review committee. <br /><br />The court said the complete transcripts of the Radia tapes were necessary to address the prayer by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) seeking directions to place these transcripts in the public domain. The CPIL has said that those portions of the transcripts which are personal in nature could be held back.",

Same thing happened to our son Tanish.\"<br /><br />Ganeshi Lal, a labourer, has spent all her savings on the treatment of his two children. \"We have sold our agriculture land, jewellery and other valuables. Now we are completely broken.

The government speaks of so many welfare schemes for poor people. However, there seems to be no scheme for people like us,\" she said.<br /><br />\"One may think its brutal as mothers scarify even their lives to save their children. However, in my case, I can't see my daughter and son in such agony and pain. It is better if they die. They would at least get rid of every day's struggle to survive,\" said Ramila.<br /><br />Sallada village Sarpanch (council head) Devilal Meena said that senior officials in the district have been made aware of Ramila Devi's plight. \"The family's condition is really very serious. A delegation of villagers will meet the district collector and local public representatives soon seeking help for them,\" said Meena.<br />",

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has also moved a Cabinet note for an immediate hike in price of petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG cylinders.<br /><br />With global crude prices hovering around $115 per barrel, oil firms at present are losing close to Rs 5 on every litre of petrol, Rs 17 a litre on diesel, Rs 34 a litre on kerosene and Rs 347 on every cylinder of domestic cooking gas.<br /><br />\"The hike could only be in the realm of Rs 3-3.5 per litre for diesel and Rs 2 for petrol,\" sources in the government said.<br /><br />An official of a state-run oil company said the oil firms have asked for a hike in the price of petrol, diesel and LPG, in case the government is unable to extend the subsidy. Diesel, kerosene and LPG prices have not been revised since July 2011. The government will be required to fend for the losses incurred by the oil companies this fiscal, close to Rs 1,60,000 crore, if fuel prices are not hiked.<br /><br />Besides, a ministerial committee authorised to decide on pricing of fuel has not been reconstituted after its previous head Pranab Mukherjee got elected as the country's President. In absence of the Empowered Group of Ministers, the Oil Ministry has sent the proposal for price hike to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).<br /><br />The CCEA is likely to consider the proposal once it meets after the Monsoon Session of Parliament ends on Friday.<br /><br />Although there is a sense of urgency in the oil and the finance ministries to raise the price of administered fuels, fear of a political backlash has prevented the government from cutting down on subsidies.<br /><br />The whopping subsidy bill has also contributed to an enlarged fiscal deficit, which touched 5.8 per cent last year, throwing the government's financial management out of gear.<br /><br />The Oil Ministry has also proposed to cap the number of cylinders available to a household every year between four and six.",

In the recent Assembly polls, the upper castes were made to feel isolated as major political parties wooed the Muslims, Dalits and the backward communities, despite the fact that the Brahmins, Thakurs, Vaishyas and Kayasthas form one fourth of the votes in the state. <br /><br />The upper caste votes were fragmented in the previous elections.  <br /><br />Roughly eight per cent of the Brahmin votes were divided between the BJP and Congress; while the nine per cent Thakur votes were taken by the BJP and SP.

He will return to Delhi on Sunday after a brief halt in Lahore where he will meet governor and chief minister of Punjab (Pakistan).<br /><br />Krishna and Khar will co-chair the Joint Commission Meeting (JCM) being held after a gap of five years.

The JCM will be preceded by the working group meeting led by India and Pakistan foreign secretaries Ranjan Mathai and Jalil Abbas Jilani, respectively.<br /><br />The two foreign ministers will review the progress of the second round of talks between the two countries held in July last year and chalk out road map for the third round. <br /><br />Krishna's visit is seen as precursor to a possible trip by prime minister Manmohan Singh to Pakistan on an invitation from Zardari. The Pakistan presidenr had invited Singh when the latter hosted him during his religious trip to India in April.<br /><br />This is the second visit of Krishna to Islamabad since 2010 when it had a tumultuous end. At the end of the their talks, Pak foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi charged that \"Krishna was constantly receiving calls from New Delhi from his political masters\" during their meeting.<br /><br />On the latest visit of Krishna, sources said India will lay stress on terrorism and early conclusion of Mumbai terror attack trial.

Mumbai (26/11 trial) is a also core concern to us.\"<br /><br />India will attempt to sign the agreement on a new visa regime. \"We were ready in May and we are ready now,\" the sources added.

If signed, the relaxed visa regime will, for the first time, include group tourist visa, visa on arrival for senior citizens and children and year-long multiple-entry and multi- city visa for businessmen.<br /><br />Pakistan interior minister Rehman Malik had said last week that Islamabad was ready for the visa agreement and hoped that it would be signed during Krishna's visit.<br /><br />The sources were not forthcoming on a possible visit of a judicial commission from Pakistan to cross-examine witnesses related to the trial of 26/11 terrorist Ajmal Kasab. <br /><br />\"We have to wait for proper consultations to begin before we take any decision on it,\" they said as they referred to Mathai's statement that India will allow the panel.<br />Cross-examination, Pakistan says, is necessary for speedy end to the trial.<br />",

    "content": "A devastating explosion in a private fireworks factory at Mudalipatti near Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu killed some 54 people and left 78 others with severe burns on Wednesday. <br /><br />Fire and rescue services personnel were struggling till late in the evening to recover all the bodies from the site of the tragedy.<br /><br />Till 8 pm, at the time of filing this report, police and fire services personnel at the accident spot in Virdhunagar district, told Deccan Herald over the phone that \"36 bodies have been recovered\", of which 12 were identified.<br /><br />Sivakasi, which has earned the sobriquet of \"little Japan\" for its unique cottage industry model, is India's major fireworks production centre.<br /><br />As firework units worked at a hectic pace to keep \"pre-Diwali\" schedules, a deafening blast was first heard around 12:30 pm in the \"chemicals storage room\" of the firm, Om Sakthi Fire Works Industries, the sources said.<br /><br />The blast, apparently triggered when a casket of sensitive chemicals that are filled into crackers later (called \"Mani Marundhu\" in Tamil) was being opened by some workers on a hot afternoon, blew its handlers into smithereens, sources said. <br /><br />The noise from the explosion was so loud that it could be heard by people a kilometre away, police quoting eye-witnesses said. The chemicals are so sensitive that even a fractional increase in day temperature combined with friction \"can be hugely disastrous\", sources said, adding that the factory's licence had been temporarily revoked for violation of safety norms. <br /><br />Some 150 workers were believed to be working in the unit at the time and many of them managed to flee the place. But the blast and the spewing fire triggered a chain reaction, spreading to 42 smaller work-sheds inside the factory complex where work was apace, sources said.<br /><br />The factory's main structure fully collapsed under the impact of the explosion, several adjacent sheds were flattened and other work sheds  damaged. The firecracker units, among others, use aluminium powder, sulphur and nitrate chemicals, a senior fire services officer at the site said. With 10 fire-fighting units and over 80 men, including those drafted from neighbouring districts, they battled for over four hours to douse the flames, he said.<br /><br />Ironically, even as workers from the blast site were running for cover, the series of blasts at rapid intervals drew a large number of other workers and villagers in the area to the site. Consequently, \"many of the dead were from among the bystanders,\" the sources said. They were simply thrown up with severed body parts and twisted flesh all around by the radiating blast.<br /><br />Even as a large number of the injured were rushed to hospitals at Sivakasi, Virdhunagar, Rajapalayam, Arupukkottai and far away Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai, sources said many of the victims were charred to death. Chief Minister J Jayalalitha expressed deep shock and grief at the tragedy and announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to the next-of-kin of the dead. Ahead of her visit to Sivakasi on Thursday, she despatched a five-member ministerial team led by O Pannerselvam to supervise relief works.<br /><br />Condemning the \"sheer negligence\" in enforcement of safety standards in firecracker units, CPM state secretary G Ramakrishnan said the units employed untrained  labour, who are paid on a 'piece rate basis'. They are under work pressure in the run-up to  Diwali and are \"exposed to great hazards,\" he added.",

    "content": "The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday witnessed the ugly scene of two members nearly coming to blows over a contentious bill on reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes (SC/ST) in promotion in government jobs.<br /><br />In the melee, the government introduced the Constitution amendment bill, which the House will attempt to take up on Thursday. It is unlikely that the bill will be debated and voted in the light of strong opposition from the Samajwadi Party (SP), an ally of the ruling UPA.<br /><br />Commotion prevailed in the House of Elders as soon as Deputy Chairman P J Kurien asked the government to move the Constitution (117th Amendment) Bill, 2012.<br /><br />Samajwadi members protested against the move with party member Naresh Agrawal rushing towards the well of the House. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) member Avatar Singh Karimpuri grabbed Agrawal by his collar to prevent him from reaching the well of the House.<br /><br />Agrawal tried to retaliate, leading to pushing and jostling between the two as other members, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, watched the scene.<br /><br />As the scuffle continued for a few minutes, the BSP members, including Brajesh Pathak, intervened and held back Karimpuri.<br /><br />Immediately marshals were summoned. Even as the SP and BSP members were involved the scuffle, Minister of State for Personnel V Narayanasamy introduced the bill which was welcomed by the BSP members, including their leader Mayawati, by thumping of their desks. Agrawal and other members of the SP continued their protest by moving to the well of the House and shouted that quota in promotion would not be allowed. Agrawal made a vain attempt to reach the Chair, apparently to snatch papers from Kurien.<br /><br />Significantly, Narayanasamy, whose seat is on the corner of the second row, was seated in the middle of third row, with two Congress members flanking him. This strategy was to prevent any member from reaching the minister and avoid a repeat of an incident during the debate on the Lokpal Bill in the Rajya Sabha in the last winter session. At that time, Rashtriya Janata Dal member Rajniti Prasad had snatched the bill from Narayanasamy and destroyed the papers.<br /><br />When the entire drama on quota continued on Wednesday, BJP members rushed to the well of the House shouting slogans and demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister over allocation of coal blocks. Soon after the introduction of the bill, the House was adjourned till 2 pm. Even after the lunch break, the scene was not much different with the SP members refusing to allow normal business. The bill faces an uncertain future with Sushil Kumar Shinde, Home Minister and Leader of the Lok Sabha, saying that there was \"not enough time to pass it during the current session.\" <br /><br />However, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said the government would bring the bill in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday. The Congress has already issued a whip to its members asking them to be present and vote for the bill.<br /><br />Agrawal said he would file a written complaint against Karimpuri for \"misbehaving\" with him. <br />",

The claims made there are completely baseless and we reject it,\" she told journalists, reacting to the newspaper's article \"India's 'silent' prime minister becomes a tragic figure\".<br /><br />Though \"The Washington Post\" recognised Singh as the \"architect of India's economic reforms\" and \"a respected figure on the world stage\", it also quoted \"critics\" saying that he ran the risk of being remembered as a failure. \"India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh helped set his country on the path to modernity, prosperity and power, but critics say the shy, soft-spoken 79-year-old is in danger of going down in history as a failure.\"<br /><br />The article has irked the government as it came at a time when the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had been disrupting the proceedings of Parliament, demanding Singh's resignation over \"Coalgate\".<br /><br />Soni however termed the report by the US daily a piece of 'yellow journalism' and 'baseless'.<br /><br />Singh was often criticised for being pro-America in his economic and foreign policies during his government's first tenure from 2004 to 2009.<br /><br />But \"The Washington Post\" was the second major US publication to slam him for his performance as the head of the second UPA Government. The \"Time\" magazine had on a cover story in its July 16 issue described Singh as an \"Underachiever\" and noted that he appeared to be \"unwilling to stick his neck out\" on reforms that would put the country back on growth path. <br /><br />\"The story of Singh's dramatic fall from grace in his second term in office and the slow but steady tarnishing of his reputation played out in parallel with his country's decline on his watch. As India's economy has slowed and as its reputation for rampant corruption has reasserted itself, the idea that the country was on an inexorable road to becoming a global power has increasingly come into question,\" the Post's New Delhi correspondent Simon Denyer wrote in the article. Denyer later tweeted that the neither had the government asked for an apology from him, nor had he offered one.<br /><br />In his article, Denyer recognised the prime minister as \"the major force behind his country's rapproachement with the US\" and noted that US President Barack Obama's aides used to boast of his tremendous rapport and friendship with Singh.",

Though first-time applicants would have to seek appointments twice, the new system would provide them options to do it online or by calling the call-centres.<br /><br />The new system would come into effect on September 26. \"One important change is that under the new system, applicants will have to make two appointments.

The rooms have four doors so that the workers can rush out in case of any emergency. <br /><br />The small units allegedly employ inexperienced workers during the Diwali season in order to meet the demand, which in turn results in such accidents.<br /><br />Sivakasi, also known as 'kutti' or 'mini Japan', is one of the oldest and biggest firecrackers manufacturing hubs in India.  <br /><br />Nearly 90 percent of the country's fireworks are made in Sivakasi.

Of these 60 blocks, seven were allocated during the BJP-led NDA regime between 1998 and 2004 while 53 blocks were given away during the UPA regime.<br /><br />The allottees which got the blocks face punitive action for failing to meet timelines for beginning production. An inter-ministerial group of officials is considering action in such cases.<br /><br />The seven blocks awarded during the NDA time had a cumulative extractable reserve of 420 million tonnes and these might have accrued Rs 12,421 crore undue benefit, if the CAG methodology of calculation of undue gains made by private firms is taken into account, a coal ministry document said.<br /><br />Out of these 60, 19 have been considered in the recent CAG report, which pegged a whopping Rs 1.86 lakh crore gain to private parties from allocation of 57 blocks between 2005 and 2009",

The CBI is already probing 12 firms that were granted licences in fast track mode but have not started operations.<br /><br />\"The law should take its own course and no precipitate action should be taken. The coal blocks which were allocated as per due process, should not be cancelled. Any such cancellation will adversely impact business sentiment,\" Godrej told reporters here.<br /><br />However, the President said that any coal block allocation where it is established that due process has not been followed, \"should be reviewed and appropriate action taken in accordance with law\".<br /><br />He said that before taking any action, the government should keep in mind that almost 40 per cent of the revenue from coal mining goes to them as taxes and royalties.<br /><br />\"There are several issues which lead to delays in the start of production in coal blocks. <br /><br />These are related to environment clearances and security issues and lack of supporting infrastructure, especially in the case of blocks in remote areas,\" he said.<br /><br />Godrej asked the government to address these gaps in a time-bound manner and also through single-window mechanism.<br /><br />Talking about the economic reforms which are needed to boost the country's economy, he said there is an urgent requirement to take steps in the areas like taxation and foreign direct investment (FDI).<br /><br />\"For various reasons, decision taking (process in the government) is slow. If we do not take the reform programme agenda forward and leverage on the opportunities, we might get into further difficulties in terms of rating agencies, perception and investors shying away,\" he added.<br /><br />On the back of India's GDP slowing down to 5.5 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal, he asked the government to immediately take steps like allowing FDI in multi-brand retail, domestic airlines; interest subsidy for small exporters; clarification on retrospective amendment in the Income Tax Act and easing land acquisition process for industry. <br /><br />On allocation of natural resources, Godrej said \"auction\" is the preferred method but it should not be the only method.<br /><br />Citing examples of telecom and civil aviation, he said the government should allow the private sector to participate in all the sectors as it would hugely benefit the country.<br />The government should also allow private players to enter the coal mining business.<br /><br />\"Nothing should be reserved for government. In the long term, the government should get out of most of the business areas, it will have a long term benefit,\" he said.<br /><br />Godrej said the country's macro economic conditions have deteriorated further.<br /><br />\"The deteriorating macro-economic conditions and the slowing down of industrial output and GDP growth has contributed to declining business sentiments. The situation is unlikely to turnaround any time soon,\" he added.<br /><br />He said there are concerns on multiple fronts including weak growth momentum, persistent inflation, policy lethargy, and high fiscal and current account deficits.<br /><br />He suggested the government to extend interest subsidy to sectors like engineering, automobiles and chemicals. He also called for setting up of an export development fund to support small exporters.<br /><br />For a pick up in rural demand, the government could consider fast tracking implementing the Bharat Nirman programme, he said. Besides, he added, it should also encourage pension funds and insurance companies to invest in long term investments especially in infrastructure projects.<br /><br />On land acquisition for the industry, Godrej suggested that the government must play a prominent role.<br /><br />Godrej suggested to create a board of mediation consisting of the judiciary, legislature, bureaucracy and the private sector to expedite dispute settlements especially in the areas like land, clearances and taxation.<br /><br />On whether CII favours additional tax on diesel cars, he said out of the total oil consumption in the country, they consumes only 2 per cent of it. \"It would be dangerous to put additional duty on the cars\" as it would impact the sector growth, he added.<br /><br />On disinvestments, the CII president said, \"A special body should be created to monitor the private infrastructure projects. There is need to appoint 2-3 more expert committees to expedite project approvals.\"<br /><br />On retrospective amendment in the Income Tax Act, he said they were \"inconsistent\" with DTC proposals, not \"clarificatory\".<br /><br />He said the amendments should be applied prospectively and not with retrospective effect.<br /><br />\"The finance ministry should clarify the effect of the amendments on the 82 treaty countries as well as the cases where the assessment was finalised,\" he added",

At the time of home secretary talks, we were  told (by Pakistan) that there were legal and other requirements,\"  Akbaruddin said recently.<br /> \"We are still trying to work it out so that it can be signed at the earliest,\" he said.<br /> Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik said in Tehran last week that  the issues related to the visa regime had been worked out. He hoped the  pact gets signed during Krishna's visit.<br /> Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who met Pakistan President Asif Ali  Zardari on the sidelines of the NAM summit in Tehran last week, said  that the expeditious conclusion of the Mumbai terror attack trial will  be a \"major\" confidence building measure in bilateral relations.<br /> Manmohan Singh said he was keen to visit Pakistan but only if a \"proper  atmosphere\" was created by Islamabad by punishing the perpetrators of  the Mumbai carnage.<br /> Pakistan and India had initiated a composite dialogue on all issues. But  the Mumbai attack of 2008, which killed 166 people, halted the process.  The two countries began to talk again only last year.<br /> After spending two days in Islamabad, where he is expected to meet other  dignitaries as well, Krishna will visit Lahore Sunday (Sep 9) for talks  with political, business and civil society leaders there.<br /> <br />",

The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission's (NCDRC) gave the direction to NIIT while partly allowing city resident Anu Kohli's plea for enhancement of the compensation awarded to her by a district forum here, whose order had been upheld by the Delhi State Consumer Commission.<br /><br />The NCDRC, however, dismissed the NIIT's plea for setting aside the concurrent verdicts of the two lower foras and said the institute's failure to pay her the stipend for the entire duration of her professional practice amounted to cheating and playing with the life of a student.<br /><br />\"The opposite party (NIIT) failed to pay the stipend during this period (last five months of course)... This shows cheating on the part of opposite party in order to save money. They have played with the life of a student.<br /><br />\"We dismiss the revision petition filed by the opposite party and partly allow the second appeal filed by complainant (Kohli). The opposite party is directed to pay her Rs 38,944 towards fee (deposited by her)...<br /><br />\"The opposite party is also directed to pay Rs one lakh to her as compensation for harassment and Rs 35,000 as stipend (due to her) for the five months (of professional practice),\" the bench presided by Justice J M Malik said.<br /><br />While passing its order, the NCDRC relied on NIIT's letter to Kohli, converting her professional practice into project mode and informing her that she will not be paid any stipend for the remaining period of the course.<br /><br />Referring to the letter, the NCDRC also rued that \"foras below have not appreciated the documents properly\" while passing their orders. <br /><br />The District forum had only partially allowed Kohli's complaint by holding NIIT guilty of negligence, deficiency in service of class room teaching as well as inefficient facility and had directed it to pay her Rs 40,000 as compensation. The state commission had upheld the district forum's order and had refused to interfere with it, while dismissing appeals by Kohli and NIIT, seeking enhancement of compensation and setting aside of the verdict respectively.<br /><br />In her complaint to the district forum, Kohli had not only alleged non-payment of stipend for the last five months of her GNIIT course, but had also said that NIIT lacked well-trained faculty and infrastructure for teaching the course.<br /><br />She had said after seven months of professional practice, with NIIT itself, the institute had converted it into project mode for remaining five months, contrary to GNIIT scheme.<br /><br />She had also alleged that NIIT had not granted her a certificate for the duration of the GNIIT course undertaken by her. In its defence, NIIT had contended before the NCDRC that as Kohli had completed only eight months of her professional practice and thereafter had abandoned the course on her own, she was not entitled to a GNIIT certificate.<br /><br />The NCDRC, however, rejected the contention saying \"It is clear that complainant (Kohli) was compelled to leave the course. We are informed she used to get stipend of Rs 7,000 per month. If this much amount is denied, how can she carry on her studies. This goes to reveal that respondent (NIIT) was terribly remiss in discharge of its duties.\"<br /><br />It also pulled up NIIT saying \"it is clear that for money people can stoop down to any extent.

Members of SP, a party opposed to the bill, were on their feet and party MP Naresh Agrawal proceeded towards the Well.<br /><br />He was encountered by BSP member Avatar Singh Karimpuri, who grabbed the SP member by his collar to prevent him from trooping into the Well.

Soon marshals were called in the House. Amid the commotion, the bill was introduced by Minister of State for Personnel V Narayanasamy.<br /><br />Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was present when the incident took place. Six SP members including Ramgopal Yadav and Agrawal then rushed to the Well shouting slogans saying reservations in promotion would not be allowed.Members from the BJP continued with their protest over the coal block allocation issue but they chose not to troop into the well today. They kept standing and shouting slogans seeking the Prime Minister's resignation.<br /><br />SP members, who were in the well protesting against the quota bill, rushed towards the treasury benches as soon as the Chair asked Narayanasamy to introduce the legislation.<br /><br />Congress members, however, tried to pacify the agitated MPs from SP, which is supporting UPA government from outside. As Agrawal and Karimpuri pushed each other in the aisle, other members looked stunned.<br /><br />Agrawal, who was attempting to reach the Chair apparently to snatch papers from Kurien, was prevented from doing so by the marshals.

As soon as the bill was introduced, Kurien adjourned the House till 2 PM.<br /><br />The bill, if passed, will enable the government to continue the scheme of reservation in promotion for the SC/ST as it existed since 1995. The amendment will give retrospective effect to the proposed amended clause (4A) of Article 16 with effect from the date of its coming into force originally on June 17, 1995.<br /><br />The original clause introduced in 1995 said: \"Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion, with consequential seniority, to any class or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the State, are not adequately represented in the services under the State.\"<br /><br />The amended Article says, \"Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in the Constitution, the SCs and the STs notified under Article 341 and Article 342, respectively, shall be deemed to be backward and nothing in this Article or in Article 335 shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotions, with consequential seniority, to any class or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of the SCs and the STs to the extent of the percentage of reservation provided to the SCs and STs in the services of the State.\" <br /><br />When the House adjourned after the Bill was introduced, some BSP members including Satish Mishra and Brajesh Pathak went to thank Narayanasamy.<br />Mishra and Narayanasamy were also seen talking to Agrawal in a bid to mollify him. <br /> ",

Among the larger states, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were substantially urbanized and this was near complete in Delhi, Mizoram and Goa.<br /><br />\"For India to achieve its full potential it is crucial that the hundreds of millions of people that now inhibit towns and cities of India are provided basic services. These services are a prerequisite,\" he said.<br /><br />Yet, he added as an example, few cities had satisfactory network of sewerage facilities. \"Bangalore, for example is able to treat only 10 percent of the sewage generated, while Hyderabad treats 43 percent,\" he said.<br /><br />Similarly, he added, a recent audit suggested that in Sabarmati at Ahmedabad, Yamuna in Delhi and Musi at Hyderabad, the dissolved oxygen levels were at \"0\" levels, indicating these rivers were so polluted that they just can't support aquatic life.<br /><br />\"In the larger cities, the unbridled rise of automobiles has rendered the air unfit for inhaling and respiratory diseases are steeply rising,\" he said, adding that all this called for mechanisms that will encourage public-private partnership.<br />",

But just as damaging to his reputation is the accusation that he looked the other way and remained silent as his cabinet colleagues filled their own pockets,\" it added.<br /><br />Singh spoke last week to rebut criticism from the government auditor that the national treasury had been cheated of billions of dollars after coal-mining concessions were granted to private companies for a pittance. He denied that there was \"any impropriety\".<br /><br />The Indian prime minister's criticism came less than two months after Britain's The Independent ran a report with the headline \"Manmohan Singh - India's saviour or Sonia's poodle?\"<br /><br />The July 16 report observed that the Indian prime minister's reforming zeal had evaporated and slowed the country's growth.  The British daily cited observers to say he had \"no genuine political power\" and owed his position to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. <br /><br />The story came close on the heels of Manmohan Singh being dubbed an \"underachiever\" by Time magazine, which asked whether the architect of 1991 economic reforms could rouse himself and put India back on the high growth path. <br /><br />\"Narrowing the gap between heightened expectations and the nation's capacity to deliver, should be a job for the man who launched those expectations 21 years ago with such oratorical flourish,\" Time said in the cover story of its Asia edition.",

Vahanvati argued that the 2010 judgment was made on the basis of \"written submission\" which had wrongly quoted the report of the committee set up to \"review the Existing Laws and Procedure for Regulation and Development of Minerals.\"<br /><br />He submitted that the Karnataka government had not yet implemented the court's directions to seek fresh applications for the mining leases in the area.

Overturning the Karnataka High Court ruling, the apex court had, in its decision in 2010, directed the State government to consider afresh the applications of Sandur Manganese and Iron Ore Limited, MSPL Ltd, Jindal Vijaynagar Steels Ltd and Kalyani Steel Limited.<br /><br />Sandur Manganese and Iron Ore Ltd and MSPL had then challenged the ruling of Karnataka High Court that had upheld the decision of the State government to allot certain lease of the mines to Jindal and Kalyani.<br />",

The Ministry's recommendations include harsher punishment to offenders with adequate protections to the innocent.

The prime minister said there was a need to set up \"transparent and reliable systems\" for tracking attendance of children \"in a truly meaningful way\". \"At the same time, we need to put in place a system of continuous assessment of the benefit our children are getting from education. Participation of the community and parents would be essential in this process, so that they can be satisfied with the quality of teaching,\" he added.<br /><br />Noting that teachers are critical to the success of government's endeavours to impart quality education to children, he said: \"The empowerment of teachers that includes real opportunity for them to share policy perspectives and decision-making will be the key component of the educational reform process.\"<br /><br />He suggested the teachers to develop in children independence of thought and action and the capacity for taking carefully considered decisions.<br /><br />\"Through you (teachers), our children should also develop sensitivity to the well-being and feelings of others and also the ability to work and participate in the processes of social and economic change,\" he added.<br />",

It will also be up to them to decide how many promotions they would give to a government employee belonging to SC or ST during his service tenure.<br /><br />The government is likely to introduce the bill in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday despite a continued logjam in the Parliament over alleged coal block allocation scam. If it is passed by Parliament, the proposed amendment will circumvent a recent Supreme Court order that struck down a similar move by the erstwhile Bahujan Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh.<br /><br />The Cabinet's approval was welcomed by BSP and Left parties while the Samajwadi Party, which wanted other backward classes too on the list, reiterated its objections to it.<br />\"We object the government's decision. It is unconstitutional,\" SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav said.<br /><br />He alleged that the UPA government was bringing the amendment to divert attention from the coal block allocation scam, saying it would again be rejected by the court. There is a possibility that the SP may stall the bill in the House, informed sources said. <br /><br />BSP chief Mayawati called on Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj and her counterpart in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley, urging them to allow Parliament to function so that the amendment Bill could be taken up. <br /><br />Sources said, the BJP leaders told Mayawati that they will take a final call on the issue only after discussing it in the party.

A blanket hike of USD 15 would be effected on all one-way international tickets.<br /><br />The domestic fuel surcharge for a distance of over 1000 kms so far was Rs 3250, which would now go up to Rs 3500. The surcharge so far was Rs 1600 on a ticket for less than 1000 km distance.<br /><br />A Jet Airways spokesperson said the hike in fuel surcharge would be effective from tomorrow, while an Air India official said the increase has been effected on all bookings from today.<br /><br />Officials of no-frill airlines, like IndiGo and SpiceJet, remained tight-lipped about when they would give effect to the hike but were of the opinion that this steep rise in jet fuel prices would hit their financial bottomline.<br /><br />\"We are studying the impact of a steep hike of aviation turbine fuel prices on our operational costs which are high in any case. We are studying the situation and may take a decision soon,\" one of the airline officials said, requesting anonymity.<br /><br />The increase in fuel surcharge was neccesitated following the steep rise in the price of aviation turbine fuel by 7.6 per cent last week, the officials said. <br /><br />In the fourth straight increase in rates since July, oil marketing companies last week hiked ATF price by a steep 7.6 per cent to an all-time high of Rs 72,282 per kilolitre.<br /><br />Jet fuel constitutes almost 50 per cent of an Indian carrier's operating costs, compared to 20-25 per cent globally. This is primarily due to the high taxes on ATF by the states -- ranging from four per cent to 30 per cent.<br /><br />Though international airlines operating to India are exempted from state-level taxes, they also pay nearly 16 per cent more than the global average when their aircraft fill in their tanks here.<br /><br />Airline companies have been demanding reduction in taxes and have also sought and received permission from the government to import ATF directly.<br /><br />Government has given permission to Kingfisher Airlines, SpiceJet, IndiGo, Go Airlines and Air India.<br /><br />High airfares have been a major reason for domestic air travel to record its steepest fall in seven years in July when 45.4 lakh people flew, 10 per cent less than 50.4 lakh recorded in the same month last year.<br /><br />While airlines blame the high fares on rising fuel cost and hike in user development fees in Delhi and Mumbai, air travel estimates for 2012-13 have forecast that passenger traffic growth this year would slow down from 11 per cent, projected earlier, to seven per cent.",

Therefore, as we move ahead we need a clear shift in our strategy from a focus on inputs, access and enrolment to what goes on in the classroom and the school,\" Singh said.<br /><br />He said there was a need to set up transparent and reliable systems for tracking attendance of children in a truly meaningful way. \"At the same time, we need to put in place a system of continuous assessment of the benefit our children are getting from their education. Participation of the community and parents would be essential in this process, so that they can be satisfied with the quality of teaching,\" the Prime Minister said.<br /><br />Singh said there was a significant reduction in socio- economic inequalities in access to education and a narrowing of the gap between SCs/STs, minorities and other social groups.<br /><br />He said the government has substantially increased public spending on education since 2004-05. <br /><br />The Prime Minister said education expenditure as a percentage of the GDP has increased from 3.3 per cent in 2004-05 to four per cent in 2011-12. Per capita public expenditure on education has increased from Rs 888 in 2004-05 to Rs 2,985 in 2011-12, he said, adding that the enhanced outlays have helped in a massive expansion of the educational infrastructure and sanction of additional posts of teachers on a large scale.<br /><br />Singh said teachers have to be an integral part of policy-making, governance and management, as also of day-to-day instructional strategies and decision making. \"The empowerment of teachers that includes real opportunity for them to share policy perspectives and decision-making will have to be the key component of the educational reform process,\" he said.<br /><br />The Prime Minister said as teachers, the state looked to them to guide the children of the country in their quest for knowledge and truth. \"Through you, we aspire to build in our children a commitment to the values of democracy, and the values of equality, social  justice, freedom, secularism, and respect for human dignity,\" he said.<br /><br />\"I urge you to develop in children independence of thought and action and the capacity for taking carefully considered decisions.

    "content": "Pulling up the Coal India management this time, auditing agency CAG today said it could have saved at least Rs 20 crore for the state-run firm had it initiated prudent action against avoidable expenditure.<br /><br />The CAG report, tabled in parliament today, said due to non-deployment of pay loaders, South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL), a CIL subsidiary, failed to utilise gainfully the existing crushing facilities and to earn an additional revenue of Rs 12.76 crore during June 2010 and May 2011.<br /><br />\"Western Coalfileds Ltd incurred an avoidable expenditure of Rs 7.62 crore during 2007-08 to 2010-11 on purchase of electricity from two electricity boards at industrial and non- industrial rates instead of availing cheaper domestic rate for domestic consumption of electricity,\" CAG said in its report.<br /><br />Western Coalfileds Ltd is also a subsidiary of CIl, the world's largest coal miner. An earlier CAG report alleging undue benefits to the tune of Rs 1.86 lakh crore to private firms due to allocation of coal blocks sans auction has raised a storm and paralysed Parliament proceedings for the tenth day today.<br /><br />CAG said, during June 2010 to May 2011, SECL despatched 6.5 million tonnes coal of below 100 mm size, produced by surface miner at Dipka Open Cast Mine. Generally, such coal are sent through pay loaders and due to their non-availability feeder breakers were used.<br /><br />\"As a result, crushing capacity of the feeder breakers could not be utilised for crushing over-sized coal to below 100 mm size. In the process, the company lost the opportunity to earn an additional revenue of Rs 12.76 crore,\" CAG said.<br /><br />The agency said Coal Ministry in its reply said though the tendering and procurement of pay loaders was initiated by the company, but due to lack of response, tenders could not be finalised.<br /><br />CAG, however, found that argument not \"tenable\" saying the management initiated the process only in December 2010 whereas the requirement of six pay loaders was envisaged as early as in March 2005.<br /><br />\"Thus the fact remains that though the surface miners were deployed in June 2010, action for hiring pay loaders required for loading the coal mined by the surface miners was initiated in December 2010,\" CAG said.<br /><br />On the avoidable expenditure at the Western Coalfields, it said in Pench and Kanhan areas of Madhya Pradesh, Western Coalfields did not have any separate metering agreement for residential colony consumption and was availing electricity at higher tariff applicable for industrial areas. \"Thus, due to non-convention of residential connections from industrial to domestic, the company has failed to avail lower electricity tariff applicable for domestic consumption and thus incurred an avoidable expenditure of Rs 7.62 crore during 2007-08 to 2010-11,\" CAG said.",

    "content": "The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has hauled up state-owned oil explorer ONGC for hiring a deepsea drilling rig from Reliance Industries without calling for competitive bids on ground that are untenable.<br /><br />CAG, in a report table in the Parliament today, said ONGC \"deviated from the standard tendering procedure and hired a rig viz Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-1 (DDKG-1) from RIL without calling for competitive bids for a period of four years on untenable grounds\".<br /><br />ONGC had in May 2009 hired DDKG-1 from RIL for four years ending July 2013 without calling for competitive bids at an operating day rate of USD 495,000 for first 180 days and at USD 510,000 from 181st day onwards.<br /><br />The effective day rate worked out to USD 563,488. CAG said the company in December 2008 projected a requirement of rig capable of drilling in ultra deep water (water depth of 10,000 feet) by December 2010 to meet its work commitment in exploration block it had won under NELP rounds.<br /><br />\"On the plea that no ultra deep water rig was available with it before December 2010, the company (ONGC) hired the rig from RIL,\" it said in the report for 2010-11 fiscal.<br />The rig, CAG pointed out, was in fact hired by RIL from Deepwater Pacific-1 Inc in October 2007 for a period of five years commencing July 2009 and ending July 2014.<br /><br />\"Upon RIL's willingness (in March 2009) to share the rig with the company (ONGC), the latter obtain the same rig from RIL under a tripartite assignment agreement on the same rates, terms and conditions as were applicable to RIL,\" it said.<br /><br />Stating that ONGC did not obtain competitive bids before hiring the rig from RIL, CAG said the state-owned firm had in July 2009 projected \"a situation of emergency\" to acquire an ultra deep water rig by deviating from the standard tendering procedure of competitive bidding.<br /><br />The company drilled seven ultra deep wells using DDKG-1 rig till December 2010. Of these seven well, three were appraisal wells, drilled to confirm previous finds. \"In December 2009, the company (ONGC) itself had expressed its inability to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas in committing a definite development plan for these (discovery) wells stating that demonstrable technology implementation analogues were not available in the world in such ultra deep waters.<br /><br />\"Hence, in the absence of technology, drilling of these appraisal wells was not crucial to decide their commercial viability by December 2010,\" the audit said. CAG said the remaining four wells could have been drilled after December 2010 when another rig - Platinum Explorer was scheduled to be mobilised by ONGC.<br /><br />\"Moreover, the Government of India had already granted extension of time to the company to drill these well by March/May 2011 under the rig moratorium policy,\" it added.<br /><br />Listing deviations from standard contractual terms, the official auditor said ONGC agreed to pay standby day rate or daily payments when rig was not operating at the rate of 98 per cent of the operating day rate instead of standard terms and condition obliging it to pay at the rate of no more than 95 per cent.<br /><br />\"As a result, it had to make extra payment of USD 1,802,005 (Rs 8.11 crore) during July 2009 to October 2011,\" it said.",

Members of the DMK AIADMK, CPI and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) were in the Well raising the Sri Lanka issue.<br /><br />DMK members were opposing the training of Sri Lankan armed forces at an airbase in India, while AIADMK and VCK members were protesting the planned visit of Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to Madhya Pradesh.

During the 90-minute talks, the two sides also agreed upon high-level official exchanges, training of armed forces personnel at each other's facilities and maritime security cooperation between the two Navies.<br /><br />Gen Liang is the first Chinese Defence Minister to visit India in eight years. The last visit by an Indian Defence Minister to China was in 2006.

This condition became frequent over the years. He would  throw stones and try to cause harm to people pass by our house,\" said  the brother.<br /><br />He added that as treatment in the cities was expensive but yielded no results, they were forced to keep Ramesh in chains. \"The villagers had started bothering us.

He had arrived in Mumbai on Sunday on a five-day visit to the country.<br /><br />Before the official meeting started, the Chinese Defence Minister thanked his Indian counterpart for the \"good arrangements\" made during his visit to Mumbai and Agra. On the agenda for talks, a senior Defence Ministry official said, \"We are planning to resume the army-to-army exercise 'Hand-in-Hand' from next year and a final decision in this regard is expected to be taken.\"<br /><br />After his meeting with Antony, the Chinese Defence Minister will hold a meeting with the Chairman, Chiefs of Staffs Committee Air Chief Marshal NAK Browne at the South Block before calling on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.<br /><br />Military exercises between the two countries had started in 2007 but were put on hold in 2010 after a series of hiccups in the defence ties between the two sides. The first exercise was held in Kunming, China in 2007 and the second in Belgaum in India in 2008. The third edition was to have been held in China in 2010 but has since remained stalled.<br /><br />After the denial of visa to the then Northern Army Commander Lt Gen BS Jaswal by the Chinese in 2010, New Delhi had frozen all bilateral defence exchanges with Beijing. <br /><br />Though the defence exchanges have started again, there were still some issues like China declining to give visa to an IAF officer belonging to Arunachal Pradesh. China considers Arunachal Pradesh as part of his territory and calls its as 'South Tibet', a claim rejected by India which says the state is its integral part.<br /><br />The two sides also have a long-pending boundary problem along the over 4,000 km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC). The Special Representatives of the two countries have held 15 rounds of talks on the issue but not much progress has been made.<br /><br />Gen Liang's visit will be the first by a Chinese Defence Minister to India since Gen Cao Gangchuan's trip here in March 2004.

Sources said negotiation skills required at the time of kidnapping, too, has been incorporated in the draft, apart from how to keep them engaged for longer duration which would help the state to chalk out strategy for crisis management.<br /><br />The home ministry had dispatched the draft policy exactly a month ago seeking views of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh as they are the majority stake holders when it comes to dealing with left wing extremism.<br /><br />Also, the ministry wanted to avoid a confrontation with the states, as it happened in case of establishing the National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) when some chief ministers pounced on the Centre for encroaching on their domain by bringing in a new anti-terror body that would usurp state police powers in handling terror cases.<br /><br />So far none of the nine states have responded to the draft policy, sources said. Spate of kidnappings and release of important people prior to Alex Menon &amp;mdash; including that of BJD legislator Jhina Hikaka, two Italians and Malkanagiri Collector R Veenel Krishan &amp;mdash; had given rise to a fear that the Maoists had embarked upon a convenient strategy of kidnappings to seek release of their leaders.<br />",

Published in the September 3 issue of Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, the study comes at a time when India is witnessing an intense tiger versus tourism debate in the wake of the Supreme Court's recent directive on closing down core areas in tiger reserves.<br /><br />Since the entire forest is core area in most of the tiger reserves in India, the court order means an end of tourism in tiger parks.<br /><br />Analysing tiger behaviour at Chitwan between 2010 and 2011 through more than 75 camera traps, researchers from Michigan State University and their colleagues in Nepal found that tiger density in the forest was high despite the ubiquitous presence of people.<br /><br /> The big cats adapted to human presence by becoming more active at night and having a somewhat dormant life in the day, when human activities such as collection of woods or other forest resources and tourism would be at peak. Here, human refers to villagers, tourists and Nepal army personnel that patrol the Park.<br /><br />The estimates of tiger density in Chitwan were higher than sites in Central and North India where tigers and people coexist. Tiger occupancy in Chitwan was 12 to 30 per cent greater than sites in Indonesia and India. According to the last official estimate, Chitwan has about six breeding tigers in every 100 sq km.<br /><br />\"The case of Chitwan.. is particularly fascinating, because Chitwan is a premier tourist destination.  (Here) tigers have a surprising capacity to adapt to high human presence and that tiger-human coexistence is enhanced by good management policies and a local population tolerant of tigers,\" Neil H Carter, the first author of the paper from the US university told Deccan Herald.<br /><br />The increase in tiger count happened notwithstanding the 55 per cent raise in the presence of local residents between 2010 and 2011. <br /><br />The big cats seem to be using Forest Department roads to travel from one location to another avoiding jungle trails because the forest department roads are shorter and hence more energy efficient for them.",

The apex court had in its orders passed on July 29 and August 28 last, year imposed ban on mining operations in Bellary, Tumkur Chitradurga districts. <br /><br />It had allowed only the public sector M/s NMDC Ltd to run its operation up to limited extent in order to fulfill the requirement of the steel industry.<br /><br />Among the 18 'A' category mines, the court imposed further conditions on six mining leases due to various reasons.<br /><br />The bench also permitted resumption of mining operation in the lease held by M/s R Praveen Chandra, who is facing CBI probe for allegedly giving bribe to then Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa.<br /><br />\"Needless to say that the investigation of the case shall proceed in accordance with law and the permission for resumption of mining operations shall have no effect on the pending investigation,\" the court said. <br /><br />The court, while disposing of the interlocutory applications seeking re-opening of mines, directed that a written undertaking must be furnished by all the leaseholders that they would fully abide by the Supplementary Environment Management Plan (SEMP) and also the Comprehensive Environment Plan for Mining Impact Zone (CEPMIZ).<br /><br /><br />",

Moreover, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Ministry sought to enhance the punishment for carriage of such channels by proposing an amendment to the Cable law, &quot;which may become redundant&quot; after the complete digitisation of cable network. <br /><br />&quot;Even when the digitisation of cable network can provide solution to address the issue of showing illegal or unregistered channels through the cable network as acknowledged by the secretary (I&amp;B Ministry) as well as Chairman, Trai, during the course of evidence, the ministry could not foresee the linkages between the two during the process of consultations,&quot; the panel noted. <br /><br />Justifying the ministry's amendment bill, its secretary told the committee that there had been reluctance on the part of local administration to act against such cable operators. In some cases, where the local administration took action, it raised such a socio-political crisis in such areas that post-haste such actions had to be withdrawn. <br /><br />The committee, however, wondered how the amending legislation would address the issue of carriage of illegal channels in such scenario and act as a deterrent, when it had not been possible to take action against the cable operator indulging in such action under the exiting provisions in the Cable Act.<br />",

As for the cancellation of coal blocks, action will be taken after an inter-ministerial group looking into the issue submits report by mid-September,\" Finance Minister P. Chidambaram told reporters here.<br /><br />The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has not allowed parliament to function for the past two weeks demanding Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's resignation and cancellation of the 142 coal blocks given by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government 2006-09 after a CAG report alleged private players had windfall gains worth Rs 1.85 lakh crore through the process.<br /><br />\"The coal blocks allocation policy has been in operation since 1993... but the purpose of allocation (to boost economy) has suffered a setback. Many mines have not been mined,\" Chidambaram said.<br /><br />Stating there was no need of a judicial probe into the allocations, as demanded by the Left parties, he clarified that the UPA government thought of changing the policy to the auction route in 2004 and has now changed it. \"But it took us some time,\" said Chidambaram.<br />He said parliament must debate the coal blocks issue.<br /><br />\"A face to face debate is the only way where clarity can emerge in the issue... we owe it to the people... I appeal to the BJP to join the debate in parliament,\" he said.<br /><br />According to the finance minister, while 47 blocks allocated vindicated the policy, 58 blocks, where show cause notices have been served, were a setback.<br /><br />Giving details of the blocks, he said that while 30 were producing coal, 70 were likely to bear coal in the near future and 58 required environmental clearance.<br />\"But 32 blocks out of which 7 were given before 2004 have shown unsatisfactory progress,\" he said.<br /><br />Chidambaram said it was the CAG's job to pin-point mistakes in the government's functioning and said he has taken it in his stride.",

MHA's decision will hit us for sure,\" he told IANS. <br /><br />Another IIT-K professor said that last year the institute was exempted from such requirements as pressed by the government on the ground that the CAG was a \"competent authority\" thus foreign funding could not be stopped. <br />\"Why did they bail everyone earlier and why are they hounding us now,\" the professor asked. <br /><br />IIT-K, one of the foremost institutes in the country for higher education, receives generous grants from its alumni and overseas organisations for research and other activities. <br />According to MHA officials, IIT-K (FCRA registration No.R-136530050) received foreign funding amounting to about Rs.6 crore in the previous financial year. <br /><br />In 2010-11, the institute's planning and resource generation department received a donation of Rs.4.08 crore from 772 donors of which 501 were domestic donors while 271 donors were from foreign countries, official said. <br /><br />Many in IIT-K see the MHA decision as yet another \"deliberate attempt\" to push the premier institute into \"submission before the central government's authority\".

I am really very impressed seeing the immense talent pool that the country has,\" the director general of CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research), the world's premier particle physics laboratory, told IANS. <br /><br />The Geneva-based organisation had discovered the new sub-atomic particle, possibly the Higgs boson, in July. The Indian scientific community had expressed its displeasure at boson being spelt in lower case while Higgs (after British physicist Peter Higgs) was spelt in the upper case.<br /><br />\"It is really ironical that he (Bose) was not given the award. His contribution to science is immense and the absence of a Nobel doesn't in any way undermine his genius or his contribution. However, we have done our bit by naming the particle after him,\" said Heuer.<br /><br />He is in the city to address a two-day international science conference, beginning Monday, organised by the Centre for Natural Sciences and Philosophy and the Critical Issues Forum.<br /><br />On the issue of boson in 'Higgs boson' being in the lower case, he said the bosons were a family of particles so the name was in the lower case.<br /><br />\"The new particle is a member of the boson family. So the name Higgs signifies it as a definitive particle and boson signifies that it belongs to the boson family. We do not have any intention to belittle Bose's contributions,\" said Heuer.<br /><br />The city-based Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP) had said it would take up the matter with Heuer.<br /><br />About the discovery of Higgs boson, Heuer said there was still some time and more work to be done before it could be successfully concluded that the particle had been discovered.<br /><br />\"We have reached the first step of the ladder and there are more steps to follow. We have set a certain limit which the data significance has to exceed in order to call it a discovery and the signs are very encouraging. It takes a lot of time to say what we have discovered,\" he said.<br /><br />However, he would not be disappointed if the project did not yield the expected result.<br />\"Rather we will have something new to work on. If for that matter the particle does not comes out to what we are expecting we will still be having something new which will take us closure to decoding the cosmic riddle.\"<br /><br />Asked about India's status in becoming an associate member of CERN, Heuer said he was yet to get any written application from the country. <br /><br />\"We have information about India applying for the membership but we have not received anything in writing. I need it in writing before I can say, that yes, India has applied.\"<br /><br />Once India becomes an associate member, it will open up new avenues and a host of opportunities not only for the Indian scientific community but also the industry.<br />\"Membership will be a boon for the industry as well as for the scientific community. The industry would be eligible to bid tenders and get orders from CERN. We constantly require various tools to continue our research which are provided by the industry.<br /><br /> For a country like India, I think it is very useful and important,\" Heuer said.<br />To get associate member status,India will have to make an annual contribution of 10 million Swiss francs to CERN.<br /><br />According to Bikash Sinha, Homi Bhabha professor of the department of atomic energy, formalities for the membership were almost over with only the sanction from the finance ministry awaited.<br /><br />\"The only thing required is the sanction from the finance ministry which is only a matter of time. I think India will become an associate member before Dussehra (Oct 28),\" said Sinha.<br />",

Reviewing the poverty line is very difficult. We can't be setting economic policy,\" the court said last week in the course of a hearing.<br />The apex court bench of Justice T.S. Thakur and Justice Fakkir Mohamed Ibrahim Kalifulla said this when senior counsel Colin Gonsalves appearing for People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) invited the court's attention to the low fixation of the poverty line norm at Rs 32 per day, an issue that has led to considerable debate in the country.<br /><br />As Gonsalves pleaded the government could not shy away from its responsibilities, particularly towards the vulnerable section of society, the court said the petitioner should come with suggestions that could be entertained without stepping into the domain of governmental functioning.<br /><br />Shrugging off Gonsalves's plea, Justice Thakur said: \"Where is it written in the constitution that food subsidy should be given?\"<br /><br />\"The poverty line is hypothetical. Its only relevance is for subsidy,\" he said.<br />In contrast, the earlier bench of Justice Bhandari and Justice Dipak Verma had put the government in the dock and compelled it to revise its below poverty line (BPL) norms of Rs.32 for urban areas and Rs.26 for rural areas. It even asked the Planning Commission to spell out the basis on which it had fixed Rs.32 and Rs.26 as the poverty norms in urban and rural areas.<br /><br />It is not just that the court appears to be less than enthusiastic; it appears to be seeking to shrink its monitoring of welfare schemes.<br />The court made it clear that it was not going to overstep the statutory regimes governing the food subsidy scheme for people living below the poverty line.<br />The court said monitoring of the public distribution system (PDS) by it had to come to an end.<br /><br />\"It is going on for six years and it could go on for another 26 years,\" Justice Thakur said.<br /><br />He said the court would pass the orders and if they were not complied with, then the court could be moved for necessary remedies.<br /><br />\"Once we direct and if they don't follow then you can move the court. It can be before the Supreme Court or the high courts as well.\"<br /><br />Apparently, a change in the approach could be read into the restraint that Chief Justice S.H.

Lokur, while adjourning the matter for Friday, asked whether it should fix the date for the meeting of the committee headed by the prime minister. <br /><br />Mocking at the PMO writing letters to the members of the committee, seeking their convenience before fixing the date of the meeting, the court said it is surprising that PMO is asking for the convenience of everybody before fixing the meeting.<br /><br />Is the prime minister to see his own convenience or see the convenience of others, the court observed, adding that \"sometimes we are short of words when it involves the highest functionary of the government\".<br /><br />The court had earlier adjourned the hearing asking the government to convene the meeting of the committee to resolve the dispute.<br /><br />Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa in May had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, requesting him to convene a meeting of the Cauvery River Authority.<br /><br />The sharing of waters of Cauvery river has been the source of a serious conflict between the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. <br /><br />The genesis of this conflict rests in two controversial agreements - one signed in 1892 and another in 1924 - between the erstwhile Madras Presidency and princely State of Mysore.<br /><br />Karnataka claims that these agreements were skewed heavily in favour of the Madras Presidency, and has demanded a settlement based on \"equitable sharing of the waters\". <br /><br />Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, pleads that it has already developed almost 3,000,000 acres (12,000 km) of land and as a result has come to depend very heavily on the existing pattern of usage. Any change in this pattern, it says, will adversely affect the livelihood of millions of farmers in the state.<br />",

If he discusses, he will not be permitted to talk to his parents at all, the judge said.<br /><br />\"The court has allowed Jundal to meet his parents only for 10 minutes in the presence of ATS officers,\" judge Modak said.<br /><br />The court also remanded Abu Jundal to ATS custody till September 10.<br />On May 8, 2006, a Maharashtra ATS team had chased a Tata Sumo and an Indica car on Chandwad-Manmad highway near Aurangabad and arrested three terror suspects and seized 30 kg RDX, 10 AK-47 assault rifles and 3,200 bullets.<br /><br />The Indica was allegedly driven by Jundal, who managed to give police the slip. Hailing from Beed district of Maharashtra, Jundal then allegedly drove to Malegaon and handed over the vehicle to an acquaintance.<br /><br />In May 2006 itself, Jundal escaped to Bangladesh from where he fled to Pakistan on a fake passport obtained with the help of LeT operatives.",

It also spent 68.7 per cent of Rs 160 crore allocated for the Mangdechu HEP, even before the first quarter of the 2012-13 financial year ended.<br /><br />Keeping in view Bhutan's strategic importance to India's security and its enormous hydro-electric potential, New Delhi in 2006 signed an agreement with Thimphu, committing itself to develop plants with total generation capacity of 5,000 MW in the Himalayan kingdom and as well as to import the entire quantum of power by 2020.<br /><br />A protocol to raise the target to 10,000 MW was added to the agreement during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Thimphu in March 2009. The two governments identified 10 projects with an estimated capacity of 11,576 MW. New Delhi has been providing funds for the HEPs in Bhutan through the MEA.<br /><br />In a note to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the MEA pointed out that the HEPs in Bhutan had suffered due to paucity of fund during 2011-12 also as over 70 per cent of the total allocation had been exhausted in the first and second quarters of the financial year. <br /><br />Though the ministry of finance had provided additional fund of Rs 350 crore in January this year, it had come too late to ensure adherence to the schedule, it added.<br /><br />External Affairs Minister S M Krishna wrote to the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee on March 15 this year, pointing out that the three ongoing HEPs in Bhutan would be affected if the fund allocation was not raised. He had earlier taken up the issue with Planning Commission vice-chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia in October 2011.<br /><br />The Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs in its May 2012 report had noted that inadequate flow of funds might lead to time and cost overrun for the three HEPs.<br /><br />To lessen the financial burden on the government, New Delhi decided to execute the remaining HEPs in Bhutan in the joint venture mode. MEA officials already had a meeting with the representatives of the EXIM Bank and some public sector banks to explore the possibility of raising funds from the Indian capital market for the HEPs proposed in the JV mode.<br /><br />New Delhi and Thimphu are likely to ink a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to cover all the JV projects.<br />",

At least six states, including Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, prescribed their own rules under the IT Act, on electronic delivery of public services and Jharkhand has its own law on e-governance.<br /><br />\"The committee was unable to comprehend the intention of the government while bringing a separate legislation for electronic delivery of services particularly when the model state electronic services delivery rules are being formulated under the IT Act,\" the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology said in its report tabled in the House last week.<br /><br />The committee felt that electronic delivery of services would have been facilitated through amendments to the IT Act itself.

The corpus will be accessible to both-- government and private sectors,\" a senior official in the department told Deccan Herald. There is also an option to increase the fund depending on the demand from the initial corpus of Rs 5,000 crore, the official added.  <br /><br />The idea of setting up the fund was first mooted by a task force headed by V Krishnamurthy, Chairman, National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council (NMCC) constituted in 2009, to make suggestions in order to encourage domestic electronic hardware sector and same was approved by the Union Cabinet recently.<br /><br />In the country, though, the consumption of electronics goods is increasing steadily, but is hardly met by imports due to shortage of domestic production. <br /><br />Currently, the domestic demand for electronics is about $45 billion, which is likely to increase to $296 billion by 2020. However the production, at current pace, will be just $104 billion by 2020. <br /><br />In order to cope up with the demand and supply disparity, the Centre has decided to start Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS) in the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) to promote electronics industry in India with the investment of Rs 10,000 crore.  <br /><br />\"The policy is expected to create an indigenous manufacturing eco-system for electronics in the country.

The mysterious phenomenon has been continuing for a few days now. Villagers in Punjab's Pakki Tibbi village in Muktsar district say they have been noticing several big-sized birds lying dead along roadsides, fields and near cattle pounds in villages. The birds have been falling off the trees in bunches for the last few days, they said. <br /><br />What has caused concern is that the region witnesses the arrival of migratory birds from Siberia in October. Even as the recent incidents of bird deaths could have been triggered by a localised problem, possibly contamination, it is feared that if the problem persists it might have an impact on the survival of the visiting birds as well. <br /><br />The Muktsar belt is witness to very high incidence of cancer which is largely attributed to pesticide overuse and heavy metals in the groundwater. Range forest officer Jeeta Singh confirmed the bird deaths and said the villagers had reported the unusual phenomenon.<br /><br /> A team of doctors has reached the area to ascertain the cause of death.  The report is expected on Monday.<br /><br />Sources said toxicity in surface and groundwater as a cause of death \"cannot be ruled out\" given the indiscriminate use of pesticides in this agrarian bread bowl state of the country. They said the egrets feed on seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands and rice paddies and the possibility could be that contamination occurred around their habitat area leading to the deaths. <br /><br />Villagers have also expressed concern that the possibility of contamination of water or its toxicity, even as it may be a localised phenomenon, may also  affect their heath.<br /><br />Chief Wildlife Warden Punjab Dhirendra Singh has said he will look into the matter on priority. <br />",

This contributed to high loading on 400kV Bina-Gwalior-Agra link.<br /><br />Since the inter-regional interface was very weak, tripping of 400 kV Bina-Gwalior line on zone-3 protection of distance relay caused the northern region system to separate from that of western region. \"This happened due to load encroachment, that is, high loading of the line resulting in high line current and low bus voltage,\" the panel said.<br /><br />There was \"inadequate response\" by state load dispatching centres (SLDCs) to the instructions of regional load dispatching centres (RLDCs) for reducing over-drawal by the northern region utilities and under-drawal or excess generation by the western region utilities, it added.<br /><br />The system was weakened by multiple outages of transmission lines in the western- region interface. \"Effectively, 400 kV Bina-Gwalior-Agra (one circuit), was the only main AC circuit available between WR-NR (western region-northern region) interface prior to the grid disturbance,\" the panel observed.<br /><br />On July 31, apart from these reasons, the system was weakened by outages of transmission lines in the eastern region network near the eastern-western region interface.<br /><br />\"On this day also, effectively 400 kV Bina-Gwalior-Agra (one circuit), was the only main circuit available. Although, the real power flow in this line was relatively lower than on July 30, the reactive power flow in the line was higher, resulting in lower voltage at Bina end,\" the report said.<br /><br />On both the occasions, correct operation of defence mechanism which include under-frequency relay and rate of change of frequency relay and proper response of governors of generators assisted by the compliance of the instructions of regional load dispatch centres, would have further assured secure and safe operation of the grid, it added.<br />",

The demand for water might touch 50 to 60 lakh gallons during Brahmotsavam (September 17 to 24) and Navaratri Utsav (October 15 to 24).  <br /><br />TTD authorities have calculated that in the next decade, the demand for water on the seven hills could be around 60 to 70 lakh gallons per day.<br /><br />Out of the six reservoirs that cater to the temple town, only two have water that could be used to run a few cottages and mutts. <br /><br />There is no water left in the once vital Kalyanai dam, Akash Ganga dam and Go Garbham dam.    <br /><br />Papavinashanam falls and Kumaradhara and Pasupudhara reservoirs have water but the pipelines yet to be laid which makes them useless for pilgrims at the moment.<br /><br />Water scarcity has forced the TTD to let out only 10 percent of the available 2,278 rooms, particularly in the Rs 100 and Rs 50 rent category meant for the poor and middle class pilgrims. <br /><br />Water for bathing is available in Anjanadri and Garudadri cottages but only three persons are allowed to stay in each cottage though they are meant to house more than six persons. <br /><br />The TTD is now dependent on water tankers to fill up the holy tank (Pushkarini) next to the main temple so that pilgrims could take the holy ablution (\"Srichakra snanam\") during the festivities.<br /><br />Almost all the 20 odd mutts are providing drinking water to the pilgrims but asking them to make own arrangements for bathing after the holy tonsuring that most of the Tirumala devotees undergo as a holy obligation.<br />",

Today Arun Nehru, who has been in political exile for nearly two decades, faces a 24-year-old Rs.25 lakh graft charge for wrongfully permitting the import of 9mm pistols for police forces.<br /><br />The case dates to 1988. A special court here has rejected the closure report of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and initiated fresh proceedings against Nehru, who was minister of state for internal security in Gandhi's government. <br /><br />He is the late former prime minister's cousin but fell out with Gandhi and joined hands with the opposition.<br /><br />Special CBI judge Dinesh Kumar Sharma, who last month rejected the CBI closure report, has fixed Sep 15 for further hearing.<br /><br />He has asked the CBI to supply the necessary documents to the accused, including former additional secretary (Home) B.P Singhal, by Sep 6 to prepare their defence.<br />Singhal is the brother of Vishwa Hindu Parishad chief Ashok Singhal.<br /><br />Nehru is alleged to have abused his position and entered into a criminal conspiracy with two associates to cause a loss of Rs.25 lakh ($45,000) to the exchequer in a pistol deal with a firm in erstwhile Czechoslovakia.According to the First Information Report (FIR) of 1988, Nehru, Singhal and A.K. Verma, then a director in the home ministry, flouted the norms in processing tenders related to the import of 9mm pistols. Verma is dead.<br /><br />Without taking advice from the army or technical experts, the trio took the decision to replace the 0.38mm revolvers of the police forces with 9mm pistols, the FIR said.<br /><br />The CBI filed its closure report in July 2007, saying there was no evidence of misconduct against Nehru.

Such channels should discontinue doing this, otherwise we will do what we can to stop this game,\" Thackeray declared.<br /><br />He then joked about how the channels would run \"breaking news\" about his \"threat\". <br />\"I am sure these channels will be running \"Breaking News\"... \"Raj Thackeray threatens to shut down Hindi news channels,\" he said, gesturing wildly with his hands, mocking the news channels. <br /><br />Speaking about the cases filed against him and the coverage of it in the media,  Thackeray claimed that he knew the law. \"Don't issue me threats claiming that you will file (criminal or defamation) cases against me. I know of several laws that are broken every now and then. Should I also go to court and sue those guilty,\" he questioned.Lashing out at Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh's remark that Thackeray's family too came originally from Bihar, he said, \"Digvijay Singh says anything that comes to his mind, however irrelevant. He is someone the Congress keeps, to take the brunt of all criticism.\"Thackeray, in a slapstick manner, retorted to Singh's remark with a question: \"So is Digvijay Singh's family from Sulabh Shauchalay (public toilet)?\"Last week, Thackeray had called Biharis in Maharashtra \"infiltrators\" in reaction to reports of a letter from the Bihar chief secretary warning Mumbai Police against picking up suspects from the state without first informing local police. \"How come most offenders are from Bihar,\" Thackeray asked, adding that there was no need for Bihari politicians to teach Maharashtra the rules. Bringing up the matter of the cinema wing of MNS's threat to disrupt shooting of a television programme featuring Pakistani artistes, Thackeray said he did not favour the inclusion of Pakistani performers.<br /><br />\"I stand by my views. It is wrong to entertain Pakistani artistes when we are not welcomed in their country,\" he said.Asha Bhonsle is also a part of the show titled \"Sur Kshetra\" to be aired on Color and Sahara channels.Last week, when Bhonsle said that she does not understand politics, and that she considers guests like god, Thackeray rebuked the singer saying he wondered if the real reason she participated in the show was \"Paisa devo bhava\" (Money is god).

This is a weak piece of evidence. The witness has himself said that the accused at the time of the alleged incident was under the influence of alcohol. In these circumstances, the confession cannot be considered as it is shrouded with mystery,\" the bench observed.<br /><br />According to the prosecution, in October 1990, Salunkhe had assaulted the victim on a road in Pune.

Bhoir and the accused then took the victim to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead.<br /><br />Bhoir then went to the police station and lodged a case and handed over the sword to the police following which Salunkhe was arrested. After trial, Salunkhe was convicted and sentenced to life by a sessions court in Pune in 1991 following which he approached the High Court.<br /><br />While acquitting Salunkhe recently, the High Court observed the prosecution has to prove that the accused is the perpetrator of the crime. \"The prosecution has failed to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt,\" the bench said.<br /><br />It further said that the conduct of the accused soon after the alleged incident also needs to be considered. \"The very fact that the accused accompanied the injured to the hospital and then had not fled away from the spot is sufficient to infer that the accused was not nurturing a sense of guilt at that time,\" the court said.",

The price of Rs 1,658 crore fixed for an all-India licence in 2008 was not the market value then. No wonder, under adverse market conditions, in 2012 the government itself has fixed the base price for 2G auction at Rs 14000 crore,\" he said.<br /><br />\"If NDA's demand that the discretionary allotment of coal already made should be scrapped and the coal blocks be auctioned is accepted and implemented, the truth would surface as to what is really the fair price presently,\" he said.<br /><br />Advani said he was \"intrigued to find that Federalism ... was sought to be blamed by the Prime Minister in his totally unconvincing explanation\" in Parliament on the coal block allocation issue.<br /><br />\"Repeated reference was also made to reservations supposed to have been voiced by some BJP Chief Ministers as if the decision to reject the Law Ministry's recommendation that there should be competitive bidding for the coal blocks was taken because of BJP Chief Ministers - more prominently Dr. Raman Singh of Chhattisgarh,\" he said.<br /><br />The BJP sought to draw a parallel with a situation during the Emergency when the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had told German journalists that the decision to impose emergency was taken by Chief Ministers.",

    "content": "A rare visit to India by China's defence minister should  help avoid flare-ups along the border between the nuclear-armed Asian  giants at a time when Beijing is grappling with a change of leadership  and friction in the South China Sea. But General Liang Guanglie's  trip -- the first by a Chinese defence minister in eight years -- also  highlights growing competition between the two emerging powers as they  jostle for influence and resources across Asia.Liang  is due to arrive in Mumbai on Sunday afternoon after stopping in Sri  Lanka, the island nation off the south coast of India that sits on vital  ocean trade routes.There he  sought to play down Indian fears that China is threading a \"string of  pearls\" -- or encircling it by financing infrastructure and military  strength in neighbours stretching from Pakistan to the Maldives.\"China  attaches great importance to its relations with the South Asian  nations, and commits itself to forging harmonious co-existence and  mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation with them,\" he said in  speech to Sri Lankan soldiers.\"The  PLA's (People's Liberation Army) efforts in conducting friendly  exchanges and cooperation with its counterparts in the South Asian  nations are intended for maintaining regional security and stability and  not targeted at any third party.\"As  neighbours and emerging superpowers, India and China have a complex  relationship. Trade has grown at a dizzying rate but Beijing is wary of  India's close ties to Washington and memories of a border war with China  half a century ago are still fresh in New Delhi.Despite  15 rounds of high level talks to resolve the dispute about where their  Himalayan border lies, neither side is close to giving up any territory.  Liang is not expected to broach the territorial issue on his trip.Analysts  say Liang's India tour will demonstrate that Beijing is managing the  often twitchy relations with its neighour just ahead of its  once-in-a-decade leadership transition.\"China's  leadership has one primary objective: how do we continue without any  convulsions,\" said Uday Bhaskar, director of the National Maritime  Foundation, a New Delhi think-tank.\"You do not want to have anything to do with India just now which is rocking the boat, as it were,\" he said.AID FOR ISLANDSIn  Sri Lanka, Liang pledged $12 million in military aid, adding to  billions of dollars spent helping President Mahinda Rajapaksa win a  25-year-old civil war and rebuild his ruined nation's ports and roads.Emphasising  China's growing clout in the region, President Mohammed Waheed of the  Indian Ocean archipelago nation the Maldives left for Beijing on Friday  to arrange $500 million in loans, partly for infrastructure.In  turn, India courts close ties with Vietnam. Its exploration of an oil  block in the South China Sea has needled Beijing, which claims the  sovereignty over almost all of the sea and has stepped up its military  presence there.Both China and  India say they are committed to attaining prosperity through peaceful  means. Business relations are booming and trade flows have reached an  annual $75.5 billion, up from just $3 billion a decade ago. Trade is  skewed in China's favour.During  the four day trip to India, Liang will talk about border security with  his counterpart Defence Minister A.K. Antony, India said this week, and  they may announce a new round of joint military exercises -- following  on from a recent joint naval practice in Shanghai.No  more details have been announced, but the two sides are expected to  discuss their mutual neighbours Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the  security challenges they face when NATO forces start leaving the region  in 2014.TIBETLiang's  delegation includes Yang Jinshan, commander of the Tibet military  district -- on the vast and troubled Himalayan plateau bordering India.  China and India fought a brief border war in 1962, two years after India  gave asylum to the Dalai Lama, who Beijing considers a separatist.The  last time a Chinese defence minister visited India was in 2004. Since  then, Beijing has spent billions of dollars on train lines, roads and  military hardware in Tibet. India has also spent heavily to strengthen  its defences along the frontier, which the two sides dispute, despite  years of talks.Minor incidents of  both nations' troops crossing the border are common, but major flare-ups  are avoided through meetings of low and mid-rank officers, as well as  senior military delegations and a cabinet-level hotline.Instability  has increased in Tibet in the lead up to the Chinese leadership change,  with 51 Tibetans setting fire to themselves in gruesome protests  against Beijing's heavy-handed rule in the region.Liang's  visit follows a number of high intensity unilateral military exercises  by both countries in the border region in the past year.More  recently, India's ambassador to China was allowed to tour Tibet, a rare  occurrence, and an Indian military delegation was taken to the region's  capital Lhasa.Jayadeva Ranade, a  retired Indian senior civil servant and China expert, said China's  recent warmth toward India reflected its concerns about military  escalation in the South China Sea, and perception that India is being  drawn into the U.S. \"pivot\" to Asia, which Beijing sees as containment.While he welcomed Liang's trip, Ranade said India was disappointed China's next president had not yet visited.\"It's  a tepid gesture -- earlier they were expecting a higher level visit, Xi  Jinping was expected to come. That would have been something,\" Ranade  said.",

Fifty-one croc nests had been sighted in the wild this year by enumerators,\" said Manoj Kumar Mahapatra, Divisional Forest Officer, Rajnagar Mangrove (Wildlife) Forest Division. <br /><br />The emergence of fledgling crocodiles was a treat to watch. The rare natural phenomenon that has come to an end recently was watched by ground-level forest staff.

We hasten to add, however, that if the prosecution against an accused is solely based on a finding in a proceeding and that finding is set aside by the superior authority in the hierarchy, the very foundation goes and the prosecution may be quashed. But that principle will not apply in the case of the departmental proceeding as the criminal trial and the departmental proceeding are held by two different entities. Further they are not in the same hierarchy,\" the court said.<br /><br />The bench, also comprising Justices C K Prasad and S J Mukhopadhaya, passed the ruling while setting aside an order of the Delhi High Court.<br /><br />The High Court in August 2008 allowed a plea of Ajay Kumar Tyagi,  then junior engineer with Delhi Jal Board, for quashing of criminal proceedings in bribery case on the ground that the same charges could not be proved in departmental proceedings.<br /><br />\"It is well settled that the standard of proof in department proceeding is lower than that of criminal prosecution. It is equally well settled that the departmental proceeding or for that matter criminal cases have to be decided only on the basis of evidence adduced therein. Truthfulness of the evidence in the criminal case can be judged only after the evidence is adduced therein and the criminal case can not be rejected on the basis of the evidence in the departmental proceeding or the report of the Inquiry Officer based on those evidence,\" Justice Prasad, writing the verdict on behalf of the bench, said.<br /><br />The bench directed Tyagi to appear before a trial court within four weeks for disposal of the case.  He was chargesheeted in September 2002 by Delhi government's anti-corruption branch under various provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act for allegedly demanding and accepting Rs 1,000 from complainant Surinder Singh, a police constable, for clearing a file on water connection.  <br />",

And it is only the illegal migrants who are at the root of discord in the North-East,\" says a booklet released by MP S K Bwiswmuthiary on Saturday on the illegal immigration in Assam.<br /><br />The booklet, titled &quot;Illegal migration in Assam &amp; The North East - Essential Facts,&quot; suggests that the government should implement Assam Accord of 1985 that clearly outlined that immigrants from Bangladesh will be entitled to citizenship if they came to this side of the border before March 24, 1971.<br /><br />The demography has changed in Assam owing to illegal immigration from Bangladesh as nine out of 23 districts have Muslim majority, the booklet says giving district-wise breakup of population growth since 1951. It also says that the migrants are taking advantage of the government rehabilitation plan after the recent violence that claimed about 90 lives to join relief camps and get benefits.<br /><br />The people of North-East, says the booklet, gave up their valuable rights to accept illegal immigrants between 1950 to 1971, which was 21 years beyond the cut-off date accepted by the Indian government for giving citizenship post-Partition. The Citizenship Act stated that no illegal migrant after January 26, 1950, will be entitled to citizenship.Senior lawyer Upamanyu Hazarika, instrumental in putting together this fact sheet, which he claims would dispel many myths about Assam, said that governments over the years have played politics to stop infiltration in the region.<br /><br />Claiming people are trying to give Assam violence a communal colour so that the real issue gets buried, Hazarika states that the Supreme Court in two judgments had laid bare the facts on illegal immigration by scuttling the government's attempts to protect immigrants for electoral gains.<br /><br />According to him, the SC in its judgment quashing Illegal Migrants (determination by Tribunal) Act of 1983, said that \"there can be no manner of doubt that the state of Assam is facing \"external aggression and internal disturbance\" on account of large-scale illegal migration of Bangladeshi nationals. It, therefore, becomes the duty of the Union of India to take all measures for protection of the state of Assam...as enjoined in Article 355 of the Constitution\".<br /><br />The students union of Dimasa, Tirpura, Karbi and Bodos, and Manipuri Diaspora, Nepali Sanskrit Parishad and North East Sanstha came together to publish the booklet.<br />",

Reddy sent his resignation to the Lok Sabha speaker to protest the release of water from Srisailam, the government Saturday ordered its stoppage.<br /><br />The authorities had Friday released water from the dam to the downstream Nagarjuna Sagar (located in Telangana) to eventually reach the farmers of the Krishna delta in the coastal Andhra region.

He demanded that no water be released downstream unless water is released for drinking and irrigation projects in Rayalaseema.<br /><br />This would be possible only when the level in Srisailam dam reaches 845 feet. The level in the dam on Saturday was 839 feet against the full reservoir level of 885 feet.<br /><br />The MP Saturday met Chief Minister N.

Replying to the ticklish historic query, the chief secretary informed all collectorates by an 'express letter' Aug 11, 1947, barring the singing of 'God Save the King'.<br /><br />\"In connection with the celebrations of the 'Independence Day', all collectors are informed that 'God Save the King' should not be played or sung on the 15th August and that there will no objection to 'Vande Mataram' being played or sung if so desired,\" the communique dated Aug 11, 1947 said.<br /><br />\"Orders regarding the new national anthem will be issued in due course,\" said the communique, signed by an official, J. Chaves, on behalf of the chief secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political and Services Department.<br /><br />However, there is no clarity on what was sung officially at the Independence Day celebrations Aug 15, 1947, 1948, and 1949.<br /><br />In January 1950, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted 'Jana Gana Mana' -- penned by Tagore and sung for the first time Dec 27, 1911 -- as the country's official national anthem. It also adopted the first two verses of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay's 'Vande Mataram', penned in 1882, as India's national song.<br /><br />The historical details are now available for public viewing at the newly-created Raj Bhavan Archives, an initiative of Governor K. Sankaranarayanan, which was thrown open to the public from Saturday.<br /><br />A Raj Bhavan official said that so far 5,000 files and 100,000 documents from the period between 1929 and 1991, which could throw light on many historical state and national events, have been classified and numbered.",

Patnaik and Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai said in a recent judgment.<br /><br />\"Any dilution or tampering with it will work injustice on other candidates\" and \"such rounding-off is impermissible\", said Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai who authored the judgment.<br /><br />The apex court's judgment came while answering the question of law of whether a relaxation was possible through the application of the principle of rounding off in the eligibility criteria prescribed for admission, in a case related to a post-graduate nursing course. <br /><br />The court said: \"No provision of any statute or any rules framed hereunder has been shown to us, which permits rounding-off of eligibility criteria prescribed for the qualifying examination for admission to the PG course in M.SC (Nursing).\"<br /><br />The court sought strict adherence to the eligibility criteria while disposing of an appeal by Bangalore-based Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, challenging the Oct 28, 2010, judgment of the division bench of the Karnataka High Court declining to entertain a plea against the single-judge order upholding rounding-off of the percentage of marks obtained by one G. Hemlatha so as to make her eligible for admission to the post-graduate nursing course.<br /><br />\"The Division Bench of the High Court erred in holding that the learned single judge was right in rounding off 54.71 percent to 55 percent, so as to make respondent 1 (Hemlatha) eligible for admission to the PG course. Such rounding off is impermissible,\" the apex court said.<br /><br />Hemlatha completed the Bachelor of Science degree in nursing with 54.71 percent aggregate marks from N.T.R. University of Health Sciences in the year 1997, and was appointed staff nurse at the Primary Health Centre, Nagasamudram (Andhra Pradesh) from July 8, 1999.<br /><br />After working for eight years and three months, she decided to pursue post-graduate studies. <br /><br />The eligibility criteria prescribed by the Indian Nursing Council (INC) for securing admission to the post-graduate course was 55 percent aggregate marks in B.Sc. Hemlatha had secured 54.71 percent aggregate marks.<br /><br />Hemlatha made a representation to INC which said that 0.50 percent would normally be rounded-off to the next digit. <br /><br />On the strength of this certificate, she got admission to the post-graduate course. However, when she was to undertake the M.Sc previous examination, she was told by the university that she was not eligible.<br /><br />Hemlatha impugned this order holding her ineligible before the single judge of the Karnataka High Court. An interim order permitted her to appear in the examination. <br />On the strength of another court's order, she appeared in the M.Sc final examination.<br />When Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences moved the Supreme Court challenging the division bench order, the apex court directed the declaration of her result and regularisation of her admission. <br /><br />However, the court had said that it would decide the question of law of whether rounding of percentage of marks to next digit could be done to facilitate admission in the course of time.",

Vehicles are parked here in no particular order and scores of pavement dwellers go about their chores on the footpath. The first sight in Dagdi Chawl is a massive iron gate.<br /><br />After the visitor identifies himself to suspicious and armed security personnel of Mumbai Police, a small entry gate opens up, leading into a tiny courtyard. There are rough-and-tough youth lolling around, and you cannot escape the feeling that there are scores of eyes watching your every move.<br /><br />Within, young and old women wash clothes and utensils. There are those carrying out routine household chores. All the while, they discreetly watch.<br /><br />Towards the right of the courtyard is the entrance to Dagdi Chawl, an old building. This is the don's den, his residential address for nearly four decades. Or at least for all the time that Gawli is not on the run or in jail.<br /><br />Dagdi Chawl comprises small, cramped tenements, each around 100 sq. feet with a tiny bathroom, with common toilets outside. There are over hundreds of thousands such chawls dotting Mumbai, and cramming entire families since generations.<br />As you enter the chawl building, in a small office, you are required to submit your identification, the purpose of visit, and other 'relevant references'.<br /><br />When you refer to the pater familias as Arun Gawli, you can expect to be patiently corrected: \"Daddy bola\" (address him as 'Daddy'). In time, even the visitor addresses Gawli as \"Daddy\", as if by habit.<br /><br />Depending on your work, a couple of youngsters lead you into a narrow alley within the building with rows of tiny one-room tenements. Noisy children run around and women chat away furiously. All the while, there are youngsters keeping their eyes peeled.<br /><br />Dagdi Chawl is reputed to have many hidden entries and exits, safe rooms, false walls and ceilings, but few would dare seek confirmation.<br /><br />And surprise! There is a special lift inside the chawl! It is used exclusively by Gawli or distinguished guests. Policemen, as also visiting Indian and foreign media people, have access to the lift. Ordinary folk must just trudge up the dingy staircase, either two or three floors, depending on where Gawli holds his 'durbar', or public audience.<br /><br />On a rare occasion, when Gawli was in a good mood, he took this correspondent on a guided tour of the entire premises. Gawli's hospitality was effusive, and he plied this correspondent with soft drinks, snacks and hot beverages. The continuous supply was maintained by ruffians who seemed to appear out of nowhere.<br /><br />On the third floor, the visitor is ushered into a posh living room with plush sofa sets on two sides, a thick carpet and a huge home theatre. The TV screen spans one entire wall.<br /><br />At one end, there is a tiny closed verandah opening into the back of Dagdi Chawl, and possibly used as a watch-tower!<br /><br />Next, the visitor is guided to Gawli's children's rooms. These too are well-appointed, with all facilities and luxuries, rivalling those in some of the tall skyscrapers surrounding Dagdi Chawl.<br /><br />Then a quick peek into the don's own master-bedroom, with a large bed, curtains on the tiny windows and an air-conditioner silently at work.<br /><br />The next is a sprawling terrace, more than 2,000 square feet, opening into blue skies.<br />On the left is a heap of large black stones, \"Kailash Parbat\" with a small idol of Lord Shiva resting on top. A small fountain from Shiva's head flows down, depicting the holy Ganga. The water flows all around.<br /><br />Below the \"Kailash Parbat\" is a small, well-manicured lawn with a small temple of Lord Krishna. There are images of cows around. 'Gawli' means cowherd. And Lord Krishna was  one too!<br /><br />As the visitor marvels at the don's lavish lifestyle, Gawli continues to chatter away, mostly in Marathi. Every once in a while, he holds out his hand, expecting you'll join yours with his in a clap, a \"De taali\" gesture. Most people clap in sheer fear!<br />And once the conversation is done, a gang of youngsters quietly shows you the way out.<br /><br />You are out again, in the safety of the main road.<br />",

    "content": " With the panchayat polls slated for next year, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has now trained her guns at Congress bastions in the state, making a determined bid to extend her Trinamool Congress' sway to more districts.<br /><br />Banerjee is on a visit to Congress strongholds like Murshidabad, Malda, North Dinjapur and South Dinajpur. She started her campaign from Nadia, from where the Congress had won the bulk of its seats in the 2009 Lok Sabha and last year's assembly polls.<br /><br />Allies at the centre and in the state, the Congress and the Trinamool Congress have been behaving more as bitter rivals. Much before the rural electoral battle begins, a war of words between them has intensified even as the opposition Left Front is looking to encash the fragile relationship, hoping for a comeback.<br /><br />As the chief minister addressed a huge gathering in Murshidabad - one of the strongest Congress forts led by MP Adhir Chowdhuri - the jitters in the Congress seemed apparent as it went on an overdrive, attacking Banerjee.<br /><br />Of the total 22 seats in Murshidabad district, the Congress had won 14 in last year's assembly elections while the Trinamool Congress bagged just one. Now the party is trying to strengthen its base in the district before the panchayat elections.<br />While the Trinamool Congress, including Banerjee, claimed the rally to be the \"biggest gathering in decades\", the Congress did not agree.<br /><br />\"She (Banerjee) has a knack of creating a mountain out of a mole hill. She surely knows magic. Otherwise how can she turn a gathering of a few thousands into lakhs?\" quipped Banerjee's bete noire Chowdhuri.<br /><br />He slammed her for taking credit for projects in which she had no role to play and accused her of using money meant for developmental projects to fund her campaign.<br />Amid all the bickering, an unfancied microphone took centre-stage when Banerjee had to cut short her speech after the public address system suddenly went dead, prompting some to sniff a conspiracy behind the glitch.<br /><br />As the \"conspiracy theory\" gained momentum with demands for \"proper investigation\", an amazed Surjya Kanta Mishra of the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) said: \"Even electrical instruments are conspiring against her.\"<br /><br />While Banerjee continued her visit in the districts addressing rallies and showering sops, the issue of forcible land acquisition - which has been the harbinger for a turnaround in the state's political landscape - cropped up again to haunt West Bengal politics.<br />Four years after the Tatas shifted out of Singur, the setting up an AIIMS-like hospital at Raiganj in North Dinajpur has been caught in political brinkmanship.<br /><br />\"I will prefer death to acquiring land forcibly from farmers. I went on a 26-day fast and was about to die, but did not compromise,\" Banerjee said, referring to her 26-day hungerstrike in December 2006 to demand the return of 400 acres to farmers who unwillingly parted with their land for the Tata Motors small car project at Singur in Hooghly district.<br /><br />The hospital project is likely to fall through if the state government doesn't provide the land. The centrally-funded project was planned for North Dinajpur, the home turf of Congress MP Deepa Dasmunshi.<br /><br />Reacting to Banerjee's accusation that the Congress was politicising the hospital issue, Dasmunshi blamed the chief minister for shirking her responsibility and vowed to \"fight to the last to see that the hospital comes up\".<br /><br />The tug of war between the warring allies started much before Banerjee's visit when leaders from both sides attacked each other on the foundation day of their respective students' wings.<br /><br />\"The Trinamool used the Congress' name and money to come to power, and now instead of trying to get rid of the CPI-M, it is aiming at uprooting the Congress from the state,\" said Chowdhury, asking Banerjee to go alone in the 2014 elections.<br /><br />On the other hand, Trinamool Congress Minister for Panchayat Affairs Subrata Mukherjee dubbed the Congress as a \"sub-committee of the CPI-M\".<br /><br />The same day, Banerjee dropped a potential bombshell when she announced that her party was ready to face any mid-term poll.<br /><br />\"We don't want the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) dispensation to fall. But I can tell you our party is ready to go for polls any time,\" she said before leaving to tour the districts.<br /><br />As the warring allies squabbled at each other, the opposition described Banerjee's visits to the districts a wasteful expenditure.<br /><br />\"Lakhs of rupees are being spent for the tours where nearly the entire cabinet and bureaucrats are taken along,\" Surjya Kanta Mishra, who is also the leader of the opposition, said.",

I hope BJP will respect the verdict and let the parliament function. If they would like to run it their way, that would be a negation of democracy.\"<br /><br />Why had he allowed the BJP to set parliament's agenda with its demand for his resignation stalling parliament for eight days, he was asked.<br /><br />\"I have to maintain the dignity of the office of the prime minister. I can't get into a tu-tu main-main or a slanging match with other political leaders. So it is better, as I said earlier, that I keep silence.\"<br /><br />Manmohan Singh is always firm in his delivery but there is an element of self-effacement whenever he speaks. That was gone on Friday afternoon. Here was a prime minister speaking with a new-found self-confidence, in effect, saying: Enough is enough, now let's move on.<br /><br />What then happened in those four days in Tehran to bring about the transformation? Plenty!<br /><br />For one, there was the banquet Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hosted for Manmohan Singh Wednesday, a day before the 16th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit opened. <br /><br />What's so special about that? Well, Manmohan Singh was not on a state visit to Iran. He was only to meet Ahmadinejad and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for bilateral talks on a day when some 60-odd heads of state or government were in Tehran for the summit. <br /><br />And yet, Ahmadinejad chose to host a banquet for Manmohan Singh - a powerful signal of the esteem he held him in. The import was certainly not lost on the prime minister.<br /><br />Then, Manmohan Singh all but confessed to a virtual spiritual experience during the meeting with Khamenei.<br /><br />\"I was particularly struck by what the Supreme Leader told me about his interest and involvement in Indian affairs. He recalled the influence that Mahatma Gandhi had on him, the role that Jawaharlal Nehru played in India's freedom struggle, his visit to India in 1980-81, meetings with Mrs. Gandhi, visiting various other parts of our country including Hyderabad.<br /><br />\"And what I was more struck by was his statement that a country of India's great diversity, different languages, different religions, has greater chances of achieving its national goals, if there is growing respect for tolerance and respect for diversity. He said that is the way of the future, human civilization is moving in that direction, and what India is trying to achieve is truly remarkable,\" related Manmohan Singh.<br /><br />Surely, a breath of fresh air that was - particularly from someone who doesn't really need to wax eloquent about India.<br /><br />And finally, there was the summit inaugural Thursday. Manmohan Singh was originally scheduled to speak sometime in the afternoon, where his address might have just got lost.<br /><br />Ahmadinejad ensured that didn't happen, juggling the list to ensure Manmohan Singh was among the earliest speakers. Finally, the prime minister was at centre stage in his own right - an economist and a statesman. He was among leaders whose mindset was far removed from the West and who did not just see the world in black and white but in the in-betweens that were equally important.<br /><br />At the same time, there were no tangibles from the visit - a bland agreement to improve the trade balance that is tilted against India, no movements on the manner of India's oil imports and no agreement on the price of gas to be carried by a pipeline from Iran to India through Pakistan.<br /><br />But for once, the intangibles seem to have overtaken the tangibles and Manmohan Singh had seized the moment.",

But I also mentioned to the Pakistan President that we have to create a proper atmosphere,\" he told journalists onboard his special aircraft while returning from Tehran on Friday.<br /><br />He said that External Affairs Minister S M Krishna and his (Krishna) Pakistan counterpart Hina Rabbani Khar would explore how New Delhi and Islamabad could lay the ground for \"a purposeful visit\" by him to the neighbouring country. Krishna and Khar would meet in Islamabad on September 8.<br /><br />During a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in the Iranian capital on Thursday, Zardari mentioned his invitation to Singh to visit Pakistan which was extended when he met Singh in New Delhi on April 7.<br /><br />Ever since India resumed dialogue with Pakistan after a two-and-a-half-year long hiatus, Islamabad has been insisting that New Delhi should not link its action on terror with the bilateral issues. <br /><br />The Prime Minister, on Friday, apparently linked his visit to Pakistan with Islamabad's action against terroristm.<br /><br />\"There must be a genuine feeling that Pakistan is doing all that it could do to deal with terrorism directed against India from Pakistani soil.

Apart from this, the handsets to be rolled out from domestic manufacturing units or those to be imported will have reduced absorption capacity, <br />Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal told reporters here.<br /><br />The minimum distance of a tower (with two antennas) will be 35 meters from a residential building. There are over seven lakh towers for mobile phones throughout the country and 95 per cent of them are already compliant with the new emission norms. <br />The rest will follow soon, he said.<br /><br />Though it's still unclear whether there will be any adverse impact on human health due to mobile phone and tower radiation, the minister said the government fixed stricter radiation norms to address the public health concern.  <br /><br />He said from Saturday onwards all the new designs of mobile handsets, whether manufactured in India or imported into the country, should comply with the specific absorption level (SAR) values of 1.6 W/kg over one gram of human tissue against the existing 2W/ kg over 10 grams of human tissue.<br /><br />The existing handsets, which do not comply with these norms, can be used, but will have to be phased out by the end of August, 2013. This means if any company has stock of handsets with old norms, it has to tune it with latest norms by the end of August, 2013 and release them to market. However, it is up to the consumers to discard old handsets and buy the new ones, having latest norms in the interest of their health, sources in the Ministry said.<br /><br />He said all handsets will have to display their radiation exposure limit (SAR value) on the handset like they display IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number.<br /><br />New handsets should be available in hands-free mode i.e., bluetooth compatible, he said. The government is also setting up a test laboratory in the telecom engineering centre (TEC) for testing of SAR value of mobile handsets, he said.<br /><br />All telecom companies will have to give self-certification on these norms showing that they comply with the prescribed limit. If the telecom department's enforcement wing found any violation, the company has to pay the penalty of Rs 5 lakh per tower. With these new norms, Indian standards will now be 10 times more stringent than 90 per cent of countries across the globe.",

They said the questioning was about their links, associates, activities and the alleged terror plot. <br /><br />The police have also seized a hard disk along with certain Urdu literature from the house at JC Nagar. A police team is analysing the contents of this hard disk and determining the contents of the seized Urdu literature. Police sources said the terror modules busted have a regional flavour with its epicentre in Hubli. Police believe that one of the men arrested in Hubli was a religious scholar and also a hardcore fundamentalist around whom the modules might have been formed.<br /><br />Most of the 11 arrested had a Hubli link. The sources also said the targets of the modules also had a Hubli link and were known to be holding right-wing sympathies. They also claimed that they were about to execute one of their targets, a columnist of a Kannada daily allegedly harbouring an anti-minority bias. The police, who were tracking the modules for the past couple of months, had caught wind of the plot and busted the module.<br /><br />Based on the information given out by those arrested during the interrogation, the police are likely to pick a few more persons.

However, the police declined to confirm the news.<br /><br />A senior officer dismissed rumours that the two terror modules busted were plotting to target the MG Road Metro station. \"They never intended to explode the metro station as their targets were different.

She described the Naroda Patiya massacre as \"a black chapter\" in the secular democratic history of India. <br /><br />Kodnani, MLA from Naroda, was sentenced to 18 years of imprisonment for criminal conspiracy and murder and 10 years for arson. <br /><br />The court observed that the 10-year term for arson would not run concurrent with the main sentence of 18 years. It means Kodnani will spend 28 years in prison. <br /><br />Bajrangi was sentenced to rigorous life imprisonment till death. The court observed that Kodnani was the kingpin in the case and she along with Bajrangi were the key conspirators. The other seven who were sentenced 21 years' imprisonment included Naresh Chara, Morli Sindhi, Haresh Rathod, Suresh Langado, Premchand Tiwari, Manojbhai Sindhi Kukrani and Bipin Panchal.<br /><br />On Wednesday, the court convicted 32 people and acquitted 29 in the biggest pogrom in the violence that enveloped Gujarat following the burning of a train coach comprising karsevaks from Ayodhya that killed 64. <br /><br />The special public prosecutor sought capital punishment for the convicts during the hearing for quantum of punishment. He argued that as the court had upheld the aspect of murder and criminal conspiracy, this was a fit case to be termed \"rarest of rare\" and that the court should award capital punishment to the convicts. If the court wanted to be lenient, then at least it should award minimum of 20 years of imprisonment to each of the convicts, he argued.<br /><br />Defence advocate Niranjan Tikani appealed to the court to show leniency towards the convicts, keeping in mind their family background and financial condition.<br /><br />But the court had some strong words on the riot case. \"Communal riots are like cancer on constitutional secularism and the incident in Naroda Patiya was a black chapter in the history of the Indian Constitution,\" the Judge observed. She further ruled that the incident was a pre-planned conspiracy and \"it cannot be mitigated just by saying it was a reaction to the Godhra train burning incident.\" The judge described Kodnani as the \"kingpin of entire riots\" that took place in Naroda Patiya. <br /><br />\"She led the mob and incited them for violence. She abetted and supported the mob, it said. Acts of communal violence are brutal, inhuman and shameful. It (Naroda) was a clear incident of human rights violation.

I did not ask for scrapping of the project. My point of contention is that the nuclear authorities should follow due process,\" Sundarrajan told IANS.<br /><br />The court also said that there is no need for getting the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and environmental clearances once again for the project, and asked NPCIl to implement all the safety measures at KNPP.<br /><br />It also asked the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to monitor the environmental aspects and also the temperature of the trade effluents discharged into the sea.<br /><br />The state government was also asked to to take construct and upgrade the fishing infrastructure, good quality schools, hospitals and conduct safety mock drills regularly so that the people get conversant with the safety measures.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a senior NPCIL official told IANS that the fuel would be loaded after a team from AERB inspects the KNPP and give its green signal.<br /><br />Work at KNPP had come to a standstill in August last year after local villagers, fearing for their lives in case of a nuclear accident, mounted an intensive protest under People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy banner.<br /><br />The Tamil Nadu government had last year passed a resolution asking the central government to halt work at the plant and to allay the fears of the locals.<br /><br />To resolve the issue, the central and state governments set up two committees. The central panel submitted its final report on January 31. Another expert committee set up by the Tamil Nadu government also favoured the project.<br /><br />In March this year, the state government gave the go-ahead to the project and announced Rs.500 crore for local area and infrastructural development.<br /><br />Following that, work at KNPP was restarted with police protection.<br />The central government recently said the first unit of KNPP is scheduled for operational in October.

The 520 MW Omkareshwar plant -- jointly owned by NHPC and Madhya Pradesh government -- too has started generation.<br /><br />CAG said that NHPC's 2,000 MW Subansri Lower, 800 MW Parbati-II and NEEPCO's 600 MW Kameng, among others, are ongoing projects.<br /><br />Even though, geological surprises were one of the major reasons for the delays, CAG said there were other factors.<br /><br />\"Other controllable factors like delay in handing over of access roads to the contractors, wrong assessment of land requirements, delay in issuance of construction drawings, increase in scope of work due to incorrect assessment of bill of quantities etc. also contributed to delay in execution of the projects,\" the auditor said.<br /><br />According to CAG, thorough survey and investigation, as envisaged in the Hydro Power Development policy would have minimised geological surprises.<br /><br />\"Other factors like delay in handing over of access roads, delay in issuance of construction drawings, etc, could have been controlled by propoer coordination and monitoring by the CPSEs,\" the report said.<br /><br />All the 16 projects that were to be completed by the four state-run entities by March 2012 have been covered in this performance audit report. <br /><br />CAG said delays in commissioning of projects led to the state-run entities losing the opportunity of generating 26,282.97 million units of electricity annually.<br /><br />\"Further, additional return on equity to the tune of Rs 1,474.57 crore permissible under CERC Regulations, 2009 has also been foregone by the CPSEs,\" the report stated.<br /><br />Pulling up NHPC, SJVN, THDC and NEEPCO, the top auditor said plans for 11,813 MW capacity addition -- during 11th Plan period from April, 2007 to March, 2012 -- were prepared without \"due diligence\".<br /><br />The target was later scaled down to 6,794 MW. Even though the revised target was 42 per cent less than envisaged earlier, CAG noted the four companies could achieve only 1,550 MW generation capacity addition.<br /><br />\"Besides, these CPSEs are likely to add only 3,774 MW capacity in 12 projects in 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17) as against 14,535 MW in 33 projects envisaged in the Hydro Power Policy 2008,\" the report said.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the top auditor has suggested the idea of having a high level panel -- chaired by Power Secretary -- with members from other nodal ministries and state governments as a single window mechanism to monitor as well as expedite necessary clearances for hydro projects.<br /><br />Power Ministry should coordinate with concerned state government and other authorities like CEA (Central Electricity Authority), MoEF (Ministry of Environment and Forests), MoWR (Ministry of Water Resources) to ensure timely completion of projects.",

Shops and business establishments worked as usual. Work in the information technology companies too remained unaffected. <br /><br />In Khammam, Srikakulam, Kadapa, Anantapur, parts of Nellore and Kurnool, shops and business establishments, schools and colleges remained closed. People staged protests outside RTC depots to prevent buses from moving. <br /><br />YSR Congress claimed that the bandh was near total across the state. Its spokesman Vasireddy Padma told reporters in Hyderabad that all sections of people were voluntarily participating in the strike.<br /><br />She accused the police of resorting to indiscriminate arrests of party leaders and activists to foil the bandh. She said party legislators and other top leaders were either arrested or kept under house arrest since Thursday night.<br /><br />Over 200 workers of the party were arrested in Karimnagar district. The arrests led to tension in Kadapa district's Pulivendula, the assembly constituency represented by YSR party honorary president Y.S. Vijayalaxmi.<br /><br />The state is witnessing unprecedented shortage of electricity. Power distribution companies have imposed three- to six-hour power cuts daily on domestic users in cities and towns. In the villages, the supply of electricity is restricted to the farm sector. <br /><br />Electricity distribution companies have declared a three-day \"power holiday\" in a week for industries.<br /><br />Opposition parties alleged that the power cuts badly hit the agriculture sector.

The party's youth wing leader, P Pratap Reddy, was arrested at LB Nagar when he was taking out a rally with party workers.<br /><br />Only a few schools in the state capital remained shut as the managements declared a `holiday' as a precaution in view of the bandh call.
