<p>I've been following the KDE4 release for sometime now, and have been amazed at the great work done by the developers. The UI looks amazing, and the attention to detail has been magnificent. I was pleasantly surprized when one of the BOSUG members saw KDE4 and asked.. "Is that OSX?"</p>
<p>But this post is about KDE4 on Windows. I've been following the blog <a href="http://introducingkde4.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Introducing KDE4</a>, ï»¿Luis Augusto, which is a screenshot oriented tour of various KDE4 software. The <a href="http://introducingkde4.blogspot.com/2008/12/introducing-kde-4-on-windows.html" target="_blank">latest entry</a> talks about KDE4 on windows, and the screenshots speak for themselves.</p>
