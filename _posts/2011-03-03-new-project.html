<p>Over two and a half years after joining the Nexenta project, I've decided to take some time off to pursue some projects I've had an eye on for a while.</p>
<p><strong>A fun ride</strong></p>
<p>Nexenta project has comeÂ  a long way over the time I've been a part of it. From the fledging distribution, to a mainstream storage distro, it has come a long way in features and community. From six employees to a hundred. From nothing to the fastest growing storage appliance. It's been a fun ride.</p>
<p>To all the folks I've know via Nexenta and it's community: thanks for all the fish :) I hope to keep an eye out on future developments.</p>
<p>There were some concerns raised about the activity (or the lack of it) around the NCP and NexentaStor Community Edition. While there haven't been many new announcements, there is a team much larger than NCP2 and 3 working in the background on NCP4. The early previews for the next community edition were <a href="http://gdamore.blogspot.com/2011/02/illumos-at-scale.html">handed out</a> at SCALE. I'm hoping these announcements will be made on the sites soon.</p>
<p>My nexenta ID is retired, so you can reach out to me via my gmail ID  (in the about me).</p>
<p><strong>The way ahead</strong></p>
<p>I've chosen to spend some time on a non-tech project I've had in mind for a while, about  which I hope to blog in the coming weeks and months. I have allocated some time to work with startups so I'm  available for consulting on interesting projects.</p>
<p>More to come soon.</p>
