<p>.. her books.</p>
<p>See what I did there? Something someone else has actually implemented.</p>
<p>I was pointed to <a href="http://www.the-girl-store.org">the-girl-store.org</a>, by Annie Zaidi's <a href="http://www.anniezaidi.com/2011/02/hence-nausea.html">post</a>.</p>
<p>The site clearly relies on a baiting marketing strategy (shock with "Buy a girl!"), and switching to promote it's cause (the education of underprivileged, and disadvantaged girls of India). It's byline:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Even today there are chances of Indian girls being sold into marriage or  sex slavery. But you can help. Simply purchase an Indian girl the items she desperately needs to attend school. Because the most effective way to break the cycle of exploitation is education"</p>
<p>makes the switch obvious, lest you misconstrue.</p>
<p><strong>Objectively speaking</strong></p>
<p>The marketing idea worked. I'm writing a post about it. I read about it via another post, by an eminent writer. The issue was a thousand miles away from my thoughts 5 minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>But subjectively..</strong></p>
<p>Is it moral to do this? I'm of two minds. I do believe going to great lengths, discarding any notions of dignity, is justified if all else fails. There are times when you risk imprisonment, death, and worse. History bears witness to great men who have chosen to make their point in these ways. The loss of dignity is the swan song to injustice.</p>
<p>However, has injustice to these girls gone past the edge? Your opinion of the site will probably be decided on your answer to this question. As Ms. Zaidi put's it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, yes, I know. The intention is supposed to be good. They are  probably only trying to help. They probably want to save little girls  from suffering unbearable, untellable traumas. And they are resorting to  the tricks of the trade to do so - the language of the bazaar, the  gimmicks of advertising.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>And yes, I'd buy a damn pencil box if I was persuaded that it would stop  the sale of a child. But I'm damned if I will contribute to an  organisation or a campaign that uses, or pretends to use, the methods of  child pornography to make an appeal.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would tend to agree with Ms. Zaidi's take that the poor girl's life is not in dire straits to require the antics that the website has stooped to.</p>
<p>Is the "child pornography" comparison valid? I'm not sure. The cynic in me points to the current crop of reality shows that can be adjudged everything from</p>
<p>A final comment on this though:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem is the attitude that a little girl (or a boy) is a commodity  that can be traded at certain times (of stress, of need). Which is the  same idea this idiotic website is actually helping to promote.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would (very cautiously) disagree with the last statement. I do believe the site isn't promoting the idea that a girl is a commodity. It is rather disabusing the idea, albeit via very risqu√© tactics. Of course, that a large part of the audience would not get this is very valid criticism.</p>
<p>The-girl-store.org has atleast one major brand (seemingly) backing it: Mahindra Foundation. This is an effort by Nanhi Kali. This is very likely an earnest effort to bring light to the issue. Ms. Zaidi's and other's exhortation to take it down is equally likely an earnest and informed plea to better judgement. Either way, both are doing more towards these issues than the majority of the population.</p>
