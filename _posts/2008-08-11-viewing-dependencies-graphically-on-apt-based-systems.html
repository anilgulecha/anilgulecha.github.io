<p>In trying to figure out how to create packages for <a href="http://www.nexenta.org">Nexenta</a>, I felt the need at multiple times to view the entire tree of dependencies for a package. A little bit of googling and I found that it is pretty simple.</p>
<p>The apt-cache command can be used to view dependencies graphically.</p>
<p>You will need to have the <strong>graphviz</strong> package installed for this.</p>
<blockquote><p>$apt-cache dotty packagename &gt; /tmp/dotfile<br />
$dot -Tgif -o packagename.gif /tmp/dotfile</p></blockquote>
<p>The complete dependency tree for the package packagename will be displayed in the file generated.</p>
<p>From the apt-cache manpage:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The resulting nodes will have several shapes; normal packages are boxes, pure provides are triangles, mixed provides are diamonds, missing packages are hexagons. Orange boxes mean recursion was stopped [leaf packages], blue lines are pre-depends, green lines are conflicts."</p></blockquote>
<p>An example for the hspell package:</p>
