<p>So a friend of mine, who'd read <a href="http://www.gulecha.org/2010/04/16/">my earlier post</a>, was right. The cabbage seller turned out to be a scammer.</p>
<p>I'm pissed. As I opened up my office today, he wandered in with his cycle of vegetable, asking for help with his daughters education. Long story short, I told him off, confronted him, and asked for the paper with the fake list of books. He refused, and started started walking away, pleading me to let it be. I tagged along to wherever he went for the next few minutes. He finally succumbed, and tore the sheet of paper. I told him to never come on this street again.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to think. He clearly could be making a decent wage given his grasp of english. On the other hand who knows what lead him to this.</p>
