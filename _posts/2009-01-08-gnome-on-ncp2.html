<p>I mentioned in a <a href="http://www.gulecha.org/2008/10/04/nexenta-and-gui/" target="_blank">previous post</a> that GUI related packages were being populated into the NCP2 repository. Since pictures are a thousand words:</p>

<p>Huge thanks to <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~dtbartle/" target="_blank">dtbartle</a>, who has actively been porting Gnome into the package repository. Why not hop into <a href="http://www.nexenta.org/chat" target="_blank">#nexenta</a> and say thanks.</p>
<p>Theres also other window managers being populated at the moment. Small ones like Enlightenment (e16) and 9wm are fully in.</p>
<p>PS: Also another round of hackthon is in the plans. Stay tuned for more.</p>
