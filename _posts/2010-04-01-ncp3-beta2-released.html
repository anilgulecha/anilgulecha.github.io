<p>We released beta2 of the NCP3 distribution today. The release notes are <a href="http://lists.sonic.net/pipermail/gnusol-devel/2010-March/001507.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>As seen in the release notes, we have a new pricing policy for NCP3.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fee Structure<br />
-----<br />
Starting with this release of NCP3, there will be a small charge for all users of NCP. This is required for security upgrades, and usage of apt-clone functionality.</p>
<p>Developing and maintaining a distribution the size of NCP takes a lot of resources, and we need your help to sponsor continued development of your favourite OpenSolaris distribution.</p>

<p>This change has garnered widespread reaction from the community members.. but I hope the users see why we did this.</p>
