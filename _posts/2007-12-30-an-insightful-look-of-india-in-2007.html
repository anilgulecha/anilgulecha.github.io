<p>Amit Verma has posted an *excellent* entry on India in 2007. I highly recommend adding his feed into your reader.</p>
<p>Go read <a href="http://indiauncut.com/iublog/article/a-blogger-looks-at-a-wtf-2007/">WTF 2007</a>!</p>
<p>He ends with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Have a great WTF 2008!</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't know if thats funny or scary. Notwithstanding, heres wishing this blog's readers a happy new year! (yeah, both of you :p)</p>
