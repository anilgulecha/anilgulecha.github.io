<p>I recently became the owner of an Asus 1005HA netbook. It's a nice lightweight little machine, that runs spiffy, and looks good.</p>
<p>It came installed with Windows XP by default, and I replaced that with Ubuntu Netbook Remix. Well (EasyPeasy, actually.. but it's just UNR + some additional apps). Below are various mods I made to make the netbook interface much better, and more useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>The gnome-panel in the Netbook interface is locked.. so you cannot add additional items, nor remove unnecessary ones. To fix this follow the instructions on <a href="http://maketecheasier.com/unlock-gnome-panel-in-ubuntu-netbook-edition-une/2010/04/25">this page</a>.</li>
<li>The applet I wanted to add was <a href="http://sshmenu.sourceforge.net/">sshmenu</a>. As a lot of my work is on multiple remote machines, this applet is a must have. apt-get install sshmenu-gnome should install this applet.</li>
<li>A Thinkpad T61 being my other machine, I missed the dedicated middle-click a lot on the Eee. Follow the instructions <a href="http://linuxaleph.blogspot.com/2008/11/mapping-middle-click-to-keyboard-key.html">here</a> to map the useless menu button to middle click (Need to add a script to startup applications).</li>
<li> Multitouch. Though the Eee has a multitouch capable touchpad, it is not enabled by default. Just append the following to the startup script you wrote in the previous step:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p># Now setup multitouch<br />
sleep 2<br />
xinput set-int-prop "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad" "Two-Finger Scrolling" 8 1<br />
xinput set-int-prop "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad" "Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling" 8 1 1<br />
xinput set-int-prop "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad" "Synaptics Two-Finger Pressure" 32 10<br />
xinput set-int-prop "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad" "Synaptics Two-Finger Width" 32 8</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Install sshfs, and <a href="http://www.ad-comp.be/public/projets/pysshfs/pysshfs">pysshfs</a> for remote access to filesystems.</li>
<li>Uninstall Tomboy notes. Install Gnotes.. much faster.</li>
<li>Mic wont work with Skype. There's 2 mics on the Eee.. and apparently the fix is to zero volume on one. <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8628076&amp;postcount=6">This</a> and <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8628076&amp;postcount=9">this</a> post helped me get it working.</li>
<li>Grab the Lucida/Mac fonts from the net and set your <em>Appearance</em> settings to use these at Size 9. Looks good.</li>
<li>Install games for when you have a few minutes to kill. I setup some online multiplayer games like Frozen-bubble, Teeworlds, Gtetrinet. There's a whole bunch of games out there.</li>
<li>Install Pidgin, tsclient, vnc if you are an IRC user, and work remotely.</li>
<li>Firefox default eats up some screen estate. Install the addons <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1530/">AutoHideStatusbar</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865/">AdBlock Plus</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762/">Hide Menubar</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/26/">Download StatusBar</a>. These will free up space. Also get rid of the bookmarks bar (View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Uncheck Bookmarks)</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://do.davebsd.com/preview.shtml">gnome-do</a>. All your actions are now Win + Spacebar away. (<em>apt-get install gnome-do</em>)</li>
<li>Install Audacious as the music player : <em>apt-get install audacious</em>.</li>
<li>Install VLC and mplayer from <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu">Medibuntu</a>.</li>
<li>Disable unnecessary items from Preferences &gt; Startup applications. In my case these were Bluetooth, Check for New Hardware, Ubuntu One, Update Notifier, Visual Assistance.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these changes, your netbook is a meaner, more efficient version of itself. If there's some other things you've done to customize your Eee, leave a comment.</p>
