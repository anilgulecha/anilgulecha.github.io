<p>As someone who has used vim for a long time, I've been won over by <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text 2</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the things I cared about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looks good with small fonts, and uses screen estate sparsely - it looks beautiful.</li>
<li>It is written with a custom UI toolkit, and has excellent font and colour selections, which allows great customisation of how things look. I know this first hand via Trelby, which also has custom UI controls.</li>
<li>It is fast on my netbook, and seems to use no more memory.</li>
<li>Multi-platform - no more dropping into cygwin/vim or notepad++ when I work to Windows.</li>
<li>Large, growing repository of plugins, that is integrated into the editor. no more fiddling with tarballs and dotfiles.</li>
<li>The "Goto Anything" system is awesome, specially when dealing with large files, and you need to hunt down a particular piece of code.</li>
<li>Selecting something also highlights all other instances of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a couple of screenshots on a tiny screen (click to view full size):</p>

<p>Plenty of room to edit code.</p>
