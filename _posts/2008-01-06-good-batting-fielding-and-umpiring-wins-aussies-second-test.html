<p>Australia won the second test at the SCG against India. Captain Ricky Pointing attributed the win to good bowling, fielding and umpiring.</p>
<p>Andrew Symonds, who performed favourably in both batting and umpiring, was declared the Man of the Match. He humbly shared his prize:</p>
<p>"I'd like to humbly share this with Mark Benson and Steve Bucknor, who had an equal role to play in our win."</p>
<p>Meanwhile India has come under a lot of criticism due to it's lackluster bowling, fielding and umpiring. This was taken into account by Australia in their game plan.</p>

We knew India had a strong batting order, but with meticulous bowling, fielding and umpiring, we were able to carve out a win for ourselves" remarked a jubilant Ricky Ponting.</p>
<p>Australia have now been unbeaten for 16 straight test matches.</p>
<p>The Indian camp seemed dispirited after the loss. Captain Anil Kumble commented, "We put up a very good score in the first innings, but we didn't capitalize on it. Our batting lacked the depth in the second innings, and so did the fielding and umpiring."</p>

<p>"India's only strength is it's batting. It needs to improve in other departments, specially fielding and umpiring, if it wants to win some matches" commented commentator Ravi Shastri.</p>
<p>There is one more test match left in the series. Will India's dismal performance in the all the four domains of cricket improve? Only time will tell.</p>
