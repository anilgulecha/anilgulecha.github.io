<blockquote>Forget Jesus.. the stars died so that you could be here today.</p></blockquote>
<p>- Lawrence Krauss, on the most poetic thing me knows, from his lecture <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo">A Universe from Nothing</a></p>
<p>The talk is an hour long an well worth the time.</p>
