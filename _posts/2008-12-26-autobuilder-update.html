<p>The <a href="http://www.gulecha.org/2008/12/05/devzone-and-autobuilder-now-open/" target="_blank">last time</a> I mentioned the Nexenta autobuilder, it was just opened and not fully completed. That changed recently.</p>
<p>The autobuilder is now in the works and since the beinning of the week has been chugging away tirelessly, working on Ubuntu Hardy's 8.04 repository. The result.. <strong>over 2500</strong> packages now reside in Nexenta's contrib repsoitory. Going at this rate, we should have triple this amount by the end of next week.</p>
<p>The autobuilder is built to scale, and all of the work is shared between 2 nodes. The pace of package porting will increase with more packages. Do you have a machine free for the autobuilder to use (and have the bandwidth to spare)? Drop in on <a href="http://www.nexenta.org/chat" target="_blank">#nexenta</a> or the <a href="http://lists.sonic.net/mailman/listinfo/gnusol-devel" target="_blank">devel mailing list</a>, and we'll help you setup. Look for Tim Spriggs (aka rootard). We're still a good while away from Ubuntu's 20000 packages.</p>
<p>The autobuilder will however not work for packages that need to be ported to Opensolaris/Nexenta. These should be few and far in between. It does fishily sound like another hackathon.</p>
