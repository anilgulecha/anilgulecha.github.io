<p>About a couple years ago, in an argument on space and science, I took the position that the government should invest more in science, and space travel. I lost the debate.. the government has no business using public funds for endeavours like these, and that it's only true calling should be maintaining liberty. Everything else would follow.</p>
<p>I've since watched the evolution of SpaceX, through it's many failures, rallied on by  it's gritty founder and chief Elon Musk.</p>
<blockquote><p><span>“We're not going to cut and run if we have a few  issues. We're not going to cut and run if we have a lot of issues. We're  going to see this through.”</span><span> </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Elon's been called "</span>a Renaissance man in an era that needs  them.". Read a very-well written <a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/200901/elon-musk-paypal-solar-power-electric-cars-space-travel?printable=true">profile  of him</a> at GQ.</p>
<p><span>Yesterday, SpaceX successfully launched it's indigenously built <em>Falcon 9</em> into orbit. </span></p>
<p><span>Congratulations, Elon Musk. Many more successes to you.<br />
</span></p>
