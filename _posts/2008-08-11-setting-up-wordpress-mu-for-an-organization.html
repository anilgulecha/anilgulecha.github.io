<p>I figured I'd write this guide for those who have certain needs to setup a blogging infrastructure for an organization.</p>
<p>I've joined the Nexenta project and one of my first tasks was to setup blogs and a planet. The requirements were thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to blog (yes!)</li>
<li>A place to aggregate feeds (aka "Planet")</li>
</ul>
<p>My first choice was <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress Mu</a>, given that I already had experience with WP. Setting it up was easy.. below is a quick overview of what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Login to ssh.. and create a directory for blogs.nexenta.org.</li>
<li>Setup the apache virtual host config for the above.</li>
<li>Create a mysql database and a username/pass to access it.</li>
<li>Get and extract the wpmu latest into this directory.</li>
<li>Add a couple lines to /.htaccess</li>
<li>Launch via the browser, and enter db and blog details.. and you're done :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now to setup the planet.. install the following</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://firestats.cc/wiki/WPMUPluginCommander" target="_blank">Plugin Commander</a> (To easily manage plugins sitewide)</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedwordpress/">FeedWordpress</a> (For our planet feature)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.herod.net/dypm/">Did you pass math</a> (To scare away the nasty spammers)</li>
</ul>
<p>Set FeedWordpress to post feeds directly, and check for new content every 10-20 minutes. When you give it feed links of services like blogspot, be sure to pass RSS feeds rather than ATOM.</p>
<p>Add a few themes and your blogging platform is ready to serve.</p>
