<p>I was in Mumbai the last two days for a Visa interview (I'll be <a href="http://guses.org/ostls/en/home.html" target="_blank">speaking at the GUSES conference</a>). Below are a few notes in no particular order:</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="400" caption="Gateway of India, Mumbai"]<a href="http://img517.imageshack.us/my.php?image=49338519vf4.jpg"><img title="Gateway of India, mumbai" src="assets/49338519vf4.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="533" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<ul>
<li>Friendly people</li>
<li>Very few touristy spots</li>
<li>The Churchgate to Chaupati walk (and those tetrahedral shaped stones along the sea) is beautiful</li>
<li>Tall buildings</li>
<li>Good bus service</li>
<li>Crowded trains</li>
<li>Travel is cheaper than Bangalore</li>
<li>Food is a tad more expensive</li>
<li>Traffic woes like Bangalore</li>
<li>Chaupati beach has good chats and a great view</li>
<li>People actually voluntarily formed a queue at the bus stop. Now thats a new one.</li>
<li>Men and women use the same door to enter vehicles, and happily sit together.. no stupid 33% rules. this was nice to see.</li>
<li>Feels good to speak in fluent Hindi than awkward Kannada (I'm ashamed I haven't learned Kannada better)</li>
<li>Gateway of India is not the India Gate.</li>
<li>It looks just like in pictures.</li>
<li>I'm called '<em>Seth</em>'</li>
<li>The National Museum of Modern art is worth checking out if you're in the area. (And so is the Salar Jang Museum In Hyderabad.. the <em>Veiled Rebecca</em> is as good as it is said to be). Check these out if you're in the area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also</p>
<ul>
<li>How cool is it to fly a few meters above clouds?! This happened on the way to Mumbai, and we were at the cloud altitude for around 5 minutes. Most passengers were busy reading or sleeping and I couldn't believe it. The view outside was magnificent (and it doesn't get boring after a few times). Just wonder.. a 100 years ago, people would have given an arm and a leg for a chance to fly above the clouds.</li>
<li>And if that wasn't enough, the return trip was at night over a thunderstorm. Seeing lightning from <strong><em>above</em></strong> is an experience not to be missed :) Of course, most of the other folks were sleeping/eating.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thats it. Overall Mumbai gets a thumbs up.</p>
