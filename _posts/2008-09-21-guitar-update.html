<p>So I've been learning to play the guitar for around 3 months now.</p>
<p>It's coming along well :)</p>
<p>I figured I'd plug Tuxguitar and a few sites/apps I've been using.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tuxguitar.com.ar/"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px;" title="Tux guitar" src="assets/tuxguitartf4.png" alt="" width="350" height="235" /></a>Windows users might know of Guitar Pro which is a software that allows creation of tabs and plays them back.</p>
<p>However what most users dont know is that a free (gratis) and open source equivalent called <a href="http://www.tuxguitar.com.ar/" target="_blank">tuxguitar</a> exists.</p>
<p>This will be very helpful when viewing the *.gp3, *.gp4 and other files that are available on various guitar tab sites.</p>
<p>(Or view those rumoured hundreds of thousands of tabs I'd heard are available on some peer2peer technologies ;) )</p>
<p>It is written in Java and is thus available on Windows, Linux, Solaris or any architecture with a JVM. Tuxguitar in the Ubuntu 8.04 repository has known sound issues on AMD64.. so you better get the latest version directly from the site.</p>
<p>Also very useful to practice your strumming is <a href="http://www.antcom.de/gtick" target="_blank">GTick</a> (On ubuntu simple apt-get install gtick). One good page to learn strumming is <a href="http://www.guitarnoise.com/lesson/strumming-for-beginners/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Happy guitaring.</p>
