<p>I upgraded my netbook from UNR 10.04 (which I wrote about <a href="/2010/09/08/ubuntu-and-asus-eeepc-optimizing-your-netbook-experience/">here</a>) to the latest 10.10 Maverick. Notes and thoughts below.</p>
<p><strong>Font</strong></p>
<p>Loving the new font! Kudos to the Ubuntu team on focussing on these  details, and specially to Mark Shuttleworth's leadership in driving  these changes. I used to previously install Lucida/Mac fonts to make the  desktop look good, but the new Ubuntu font is sweet too (and I notice  many similarities to Lucida Grande as well). This font is a little less  thick,and looks very good in small sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Gnome-do</strong></p>
<p>The old netbook-launcher is gone (and I don't really miss it.. gnome-do is more than enough). I hardly ever reach for the gnome main menu now.</p>
<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The middleclick solution works as before.</li>
<li>Like the global-menu applet (apt-get install indicator-applet-appmenu). One more row of free space on the desktop with the menu-bar moved to the panel.</li>
<li>Set the gnome panel to auto-hide, and save that space as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Maverick is the best to have come out of the Ubuntu project in terms of polish. Kudos to the team behind the release.</p>
