<blockquote>"NCP2 will be released in 1 month so file your bugs, make your additions and voice your opinion now or forever hold your peace!"</p></blockquote>
<p>The blueprint you need to keep track of NCP2 release is up at launchpad titled <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nexenta/+spec/hardy-release" target="_blank">"hardy release"</a>.</p>
<p>So there. You have been informed.. if there was a particular bug, or change for NCP you had in mind, let us know! We're so interested, we've created the following ways for you to let us know:</p>
<p>IRC : <a href="http://www.nexenta.org/chat" target="_blank">#nexenta on freenode</a></p>
<p>Mailing list : <a href="http://lists.sonic.net/mailman/listinfo/gnusol-devel">gnusol-devel</a></p>
<p>Launchpad bugs : <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nexenta/+filebug" target="_blank">File a bug..</a></p>
<p>There are a bunch of things to be done, so your help with development and polishing of NCP2 is welcome and appriciated.</p>
